<p><a name="para_1"><b>1.</b></a> Success in battle is the ultimate object of all military training;
success may be looked for only when the training is intelligent and
thorough.</p>

<p><a name="para_2"><b>2.</b></a> Commanding officers are accountable for the proper training of
their respective organizations within the limits prescribed by
regulations and orders.</p>

<p>The excellence of an organization is judged by its field efficiency.
The field efficiency of an organization depends primarily upon its
effectiveness as a whole. Thoroughness and uniformity in the training
of the units of an organization are indispensable to the efficiency of
the whole; it is by such means alone that the requisite teamwork may
be developed.</p>

<p><a name="para_3"><b>3.</b></a> Simple movements and elastic formations are essential to correct
training for battle.</p>

<p><a name="para_4"><b>4.</b></a> The Drill Regulations are furnished as a guide. They provide the
principles for training and for increasing the probability of success
in battle.</p>

<p>In the interpretation of the regulations, the spirit must be sought.
Quibbling over the minuti&#230; of form is indicative of failure to grasp
the spirit.</p>

<p><a name="para_5"><b>5.</b></a> The principles of combat are considered in
<a href="#Part_II_COMBAT">Part II</a> of these
regulations. They are treated in the various schools included in
<a href="#PART_I_DRILL">Part
I</a> only to the extent necessary to indicate the functions of the
various commanders and the division of responsibility between them.
The amplification necessary to a proper understanding of their
application is to be sought in <a href="#Part_II_COMBAT">Part II</a>.</p>

<p><a name="para_6"><b>6.</b></a> The following important distinctions must be observed:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Drills executed at <span class="sans">attention</span> and the ceremonies are
<span class="sans">disciplinary exercises</span> designed to teach precise and soldierly
movement, and to inculcate that prompt and subconscious obedience
which is essential to proper military control. To this end,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg&#160;10]</a></span> smartness
and precision should be exacted in the execution of every detail. Such
drills should be frequent, but short.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The purpose of <span class="sans">extended order drill</span> is to teach the
<span class="sans">mechanism</span> of deployment, of the firings, and, in general, of the
employment of troops in combat. Such drills are in the nature of
disciplinary exercises and should be frequent, thorough, and exact in
order to habituate men to the firm control of their leaders. Extended
order drill is executed <span class="sans">at ease</span>. The company is the largest unit
which executes extended order drill.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <span class="sans">Field exercises</span> are for instruction in the duties incident to
campaign. Assumed situations are employed. Each exercise should
conclude with a discussion, on the ground, of the exercise and
principles involved.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The <span class="sans">combat exercise, a form of field exercise</span> of the company,
battalion, and larger units, consists of the <span class="sans">application of tactical
principles</span> to assumed situations, employing in the execution the
appropriate formations and movements of close and extended order.</p>

<p>Combat exercises must simulate, as far as possible, the battle
conditions assumed. In order to familiarize both officers and men with
such conditions, companies and battalions will frequently be
consolidated to provide war-strength organizations. Officers and
noncommissioned officers not required to complete the full quota of
the units participating are assigned as observers or umpires.</p>

<p>The firing line can rarely be controlled by the voice alone; thorough
training to insure the proper use of prescribed signals is necessary.</p>

<p>The exercise should be followed by a brief drill at attention in order
to restore smartness and control.</p>

<p><a name="para_7"><b>7.</b></a> In field exercises the enemy is said to be <span class="sans">imaginary</span> when his
position and force are merely assumed; <span class="sans">outlined</span> when his position
and force are indicated by a few men; <span class="sans">represented</span> when a body of
troop acts as such.</p>


<h4><span class="sans">General Rules for Drills and Formations.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_8"><b>8.</b></a> When the <span class="sans">preparatory</span> command consists of more than one part, its
elements are arranged as follows:</p>

<p>(1) For movements to be executed successively by the subdivisions or
elements of an organization: (<i>a</i>) Description of the movement; (<i>b</i>)
how executed, or on what element executed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg&#160;11]</a></span></p>

<p>(2) For movements to be executed simultaneously by the subdivisions of
an organization: (<i>a</i>) The designation of the subdivisions; (<i>b</i>) the
movement to be executed.</p>

<p><a name="para_9"><b>9.</b></a> Movements that may be executed toward either flank are explained as
toward but one flank, it being necessary to substitute the word &quot;left&quot;
for &quot;right,&quot; and the reverse, to have the explanation of the
corresponding movement toward the other flank. The commands are given
for the execution of the movements toward either flank. The substitute
word of the command is placed within parentheses.</p>

<p><a name="para_10"><b>10.</b></a> Any movement may be executed either from the halt or when
marching, unless otherwise prescribed. If at a halt, the command for
movements involving marching need not be prefaced by <span class="sans">forward</span>, as 1.
<span class="sans">Column right (left)</span>, 2. <span class="sans">MARCH</span>.</p>

<p><a name="para_11"><b>11.</b></a> Any movement not specially excepted may be executed in double
time.</p>

<p>If at a halt, or if marching in quick time, the command <span class="sans">double time</span>
precedes the command of execution.</p>

<p><a name="para_12"><b>12.</b></a> In successive movements executed in double time the leading or
base unit marches in <span class="sans">quick time</span> when not otherwise prescribed; the
other units march in <span class="sans">double time</span> to their places in the formation
ordered and then conform to the gait of the leading or base unit. If
marching in double time, the command <span class="sans">double time</span> is omitted. The
leading or base unit marches in <span class="sans">quick time</span>; the other units continue
at double time to their places in the formation ordered and then
conform to the gait of the leading or base unit.</p>

<p><a name="para_13"><b>13.</b></a> To hasten the execution of a movement begun in quick time, the
command: 1. <span class="sans">Double time</span>, 2. <span class="sans">MARCH</span>, is given. The leading or base
unit continues to march in quick time, or remains at halt if already
halted; the other units complete the execution of the movement in
double time and then conform to the gait of the leading or base unit.</p>

<p><a name="para_14"><b>14.</b></a> To stay the execution of a movement when marching, for the
correction of errors, the command: 1. <span class="sans">In place</span>, 2. <span class="sans">HALT</span>, is given.
All halt and stand fast, without changing the position of the pieces.
To resume the movement the command: 1. <span class="sans">Resume</span>, 2. <span class="sans">MARCH</span>, is given.</p>

<p><a name="para_15"><b>15.</b></a> To revoke a preparatory command, or, being at a halt, to begin
anew a movement improperly begun, the command, <span class="sans">AS YOU WERE</span>, is
given, at which the movement ceases and the former position is
resumed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg&#160;12]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="para_16"><b>16.</b></a> Unless otherwise announced, the guide of a company or subdivision
of a company in line is <span class="sans">right</span>; of a battalion in line or line of
subdivisions or of a deployed line, <span class="sans">center</span>; of a rank in column of
squads, toward the side of the guide of the company.</p>

<p>To march with guide other than as prescribed above, or to change the
guide: <span class="sans">Guide (right, left</span>, or <span class="sans">center)</span>.</p>

<p>In successive formations into line, the guide is toward the point of
rest; in platoons or larger subdivisions it is so announced.</p>

<p>The announcement of the guide, when given in connection with a
movement, follows the command of execution for that movement.
Exception: 1. <span class="sans">As skirmishers, guide right (left</span> or <span class="sans">center)</span>, 2.
<span class="sans">MARCH</span>. (<i>C.I.D.R., No. 2.</i>)</p>

<p><a name="para_17"><b>17.</b></a> <span class="sans">The turn on the fixed pivot</span> by subdivisions is used in all
formations from line into column and the reverse.</p>

<p><span class="sans">The turn on the moving pivot</span> is used by subdivisions of a column in
executing changes of direction.</p>

<p><a name="para_18"><b>18.</b></a> Partial changes of direction may be executed:</p>

<p>By interpolating in the preparatory command the word <span class="sans">half</span>, as
<span class="sans">Column half right (left)</span>, or <span class="sans">Right (left) half turn</span>. A change of
direction of 45&#176; is executed.</p>

<p>By the command: <span class="sans">INCLINE TO THE RIGHT (LEFT)</span>. The guide, or guiding
element, moves in the indicated direction and the remainder of the
command conforms. This movement effects slight changes of direction.</p>

<p><a name="para_19"><b>19.</b></a> The designations <span class="sans">line of platoons</span>, <span class="sans">line of companies</span>, <span class="sans">line of
battalions</span>, etc., refer to the formations in which the platoons,
companies, battalions, etc., each in column of squads, are in line.</p>

<p><a name="para_20"><b>20.</b></a> Full distance in column of subdivisions is such that in forming
line to the right or left the subdivisions will have their proper
intervals.</p>

<p>In column of subdivisions the guide of the leading subdivision is
charged with the step and direction; the guides in rear preserve the
trace, step, and distance.</p>

<p><a name="para_21"><b>21.</b></a> In close order, all details, detachments, and other bodies of
troops are habitually formed in double rank.</p>

<p>To insure uniformity of interval between files when falling in and in
alignments, each man places the palm of the left hand upon the hip,
fingers pointing downward. In the first case the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg&#160;13]</a></span> hand is dropped by
the side when the next man on the left has his interval; in the second
case, at the command <span class="sans">front</span>.</p>

<p><a name="para_22"><b>22.</b></a> The posts of officers, noncommissioned officers, special units
(such as band or machine-gun company), etc., in the various formations
of the company, battalion, or regiment, are shown in plates.</p>

<p>In all changes from one formation to another involving a change of
post on the part of any of these, posts are promptly taken by the most
convenient route as soon as practicable after the command of execution
for the movement; officers and noncommissioned officers who have
prescribed duties in connection with the movement ordered, take their
new posts when such duties are completed.</p>

<p>As instructors, officers and noncommissioned officers go wherever
their presence is necessary. As file closers it is their duty to
rectify mistakes and insure steadiness and promptness in the ranks.</p>

<p><a name="para_23"><b>23.</b></a> Except at ceremonies, the special units have no fixed places. They
take places as directed; in the absence of directions, they conform as
nearly as practicable to the plates, and in subsequent movements
maintain their relative positions with respect to the flank or end of
the command on which they were originally posted.</p>

<p><a name="para_24"><b>24.</b></a> General, field, and staff officers are habitually mounted. The
staff of an officer forms in single rank 3 paces in rear of him, the
right of the rank extending 1 pace to the right of a point directly in
rear of him. Members of the staff are arranged in order from right to
left as follows: General staff officers, adjutant, aids, other staff
officers, arranged in each classification in order of rank, the senior
on the right. The flag of the general officer and the orderlies are 3
paces in rear of the staff, the flag on the right. When necessary to
reduce the front of the staff and orderlies, each line executes <span class="sans">twos
right</span> or <span class="sans">fours right</span>, as explained in the Cavalry Drill
Regulations, and follows the commander.</p>

<p>When not otherwise prescribed, staff officers draw and return saber
with their chief.</p>

<p><a name="para_25"><b>25.</b></a> In making the about, an officer, mounted, habitually turns to the
left.</p>

<p>When the commander faces to give commands, the staff, flag, and
orderlies do not change position.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg&#160;14]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="para_26"><b>26.</b></a> When making or receiving official reports, or on meeting out of
doors, all officers will salute.</p>

<p>Military courtesy requires the junior to salute first, but when the
salute is introductory to a report made at a military ceremony or
formation, to the representative of a common superior (as, for
example, to the adjutant, officer of the day, etc.), the officer
making the report, whatever his rank, will salute first; the officer
to whom the report is made will acknowledge by saluting that he has
received and understood the report.</p>

<p>(<i>C.I.D.R., Nos. 6 and 17.</i>)</p>

<p><a name="para_27"><b>27.</b></a> For ceremonies, all mounted enlisted men of a regiment or smaller
unit, except those belonging to the machine-gun organizations, are
consolidated into a detachment; the senior present commands if no
officer is in charge. The detachment is formed as a platoon or squad
of cavalry in line or column of fours; noncommissioned staff officers
are on the right or in the leading ranks.</p>

<p><a name="para_28"><b>28.</b></a> For ceremonies, such of the noncommissioned staff officers as are
dismounted are formed 5 paces in rear of the color, in order of rank
from right to left. In column of squads they march as file closers.</p>

<p><a name="para_29"><b>29.</b></a> Other than for ceremonies, noncommissioned staff officers and
orderlies accompany their immediate chiefs unless otherwise directed.
If mounted, the noncommissioned staff officers are ordinarily posted
on the right or at the head of the orderlies.</p>

<p><a name="para_30"><b>30.</b></a> In all formations and movements a noncommissioned officer
commanding a platoon or company carries his piece as the men do, if he
is so armed, and takes the same post as an officer in like situation.
When the command is formed in line for ceremonies, a noncommissioned
officer commanding a company takes post on the right of the right
guide after the company has been aligned.</p>

either a <span class="sans">command</span>, <span class="sans">signal</span>, or <span class="sans">order</span> is employed, as best suits
the occasion, or one may be used in conjunction with another.</p>

<p><a name="para_32"><b>32.</b></a> Signals should be freely used in instruction, in order that
officers and men may readily know them. In making arm signals the
saber, rifle, or headdress may be held in the hand.</p>

<p><a name="para_33"><b>33.</b></a> Officers and men fix their attention at the first word of command,
the first note of the bugle or whistle, or the first motion of the

<p>Officers, battalion noncommissioned staff officers, platoon leaders,
guides, and musicians are equipped with whistles.</p>

<p>The major and his staff will use a whistle of distinctive tone; the
captain and company musicians a second and distinctive whistle; the
platoon leaders and guides a third distinctive whistle.</p>

<p>(<i>C.I.D.R., No. 15.</i>)</p>

<p>Before or during an engagement special signals may be agreed upon to
facilitate the solution of such special difficulties as the particular
situation is likely to develop, but it must be remembered that
simplicity and certainty are indispensable qualities of a signal.</p>


<h4><span class="sans">Orders.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_36"><b>36.</b></a> In these regulations an <span class="sans">order</span> embraces instructions or
directions given orally or in writing in terms suited to the
particular occasion and not prescribed herein.</p>

<p><span class="sans">Orders</span> are employed only when the <span class="sans">commands</span> prescribed herein do

<h4><span class="sans">Commands.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_37"><b>37.</b></a> In these regulations a <span class="sans">command</span> is the will of the commander
expressed in the phraseology prescribed herein.</p>

<p><a name="para_38"><b>38.</b></a> There are two kinds of commands:</p>

<p>The <span class="sans">preparatory</span> command, such as <span class="sans">forward</span>, indicates the movement
that is to be executed.</p>

<p>The command of <span class="sans">execution</span>, such as <span class="sans">MARCH</span>, <span class="sans">HALT</span>, or <span class="sans">ARMS</span>, causes
the execution.</p>

<p><span class="sans">Preparatory</span> commands are distinguished by <span class="sans">italics</span>, those of
<span class="sans">execution</span> by <span class="sans">CAPITALS</span>.</p>

<p>Where it is not mentioned in the text who gives the commands
prescribed, they are to be given by the commander of the unit
concerned.</p>

<p>The <span class="sans">preparatory</span> command should be given at such an interval of time
before the command of <span class="sans">execution</span> as to admit of being properly
understood: the command of <span class="sans">execution</span> should be given at the instant
the movement is to commence.</p>

<p>The tone of command is animated, distinct, and of a loudness
proportioned to the number of men for whom it is intended.</p>

<p>Each <span class="sans">preparatory</span> command is enunciated distinctly, with a rising
inflection at the end, and in such manner that the command of
<span class="sans">execution</span> may be more energetic.</p>

<p>The command of <span class="sans">execution</span> is firm in tone and brief.</p>

<p><a name="para_39"><b>39.</b></a> Majors and commanders of units larger than a battalion repeat such
commands of their superiors as are to be executed by their units,

that executes a movement at the command of execution of its commander.</p>

<p><a name="para_40"><b>40.</b></a> When giving commands to troops it is usually best to face toward
them.</p>

<h4><span class="sans">Bugle Signals.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_41"><b>41.</b></a> The authorized <a href="#BUGLE_SIGNALS">bugle signals</a> are published in
<a href="#Part_V_MANUALS">Part V</a> of these

<p>The following bugle signals may be used off the battle field, when not
likely to convey information to the enemy:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<span class="sans"><a href="#BUGLE41">Charge.</a></span><br />
<span class="sans"><a href="#BUGLE09">Assemble, march.</a></span></p>
</div>

<p>These signals are used only when intended for the entire firing line;
hence they can be authorized only by the commander of a unit (for
example, a regiment or brigade) which occupies a distinct section of
the battle field. Exception: <span class="sans"><a href="#BUGLE40">Fix bayonet</a></span>. (See
<a href="#para_318">par. 318</a>.)</p>

<p>The following bugle signals are used in exceptional cases on the
battle field. Their principal uses are in field exercises and practice
firing.</p>

<p><span class="sans"><a href="#BUGLE38">Commence firing</a>:</span> Officers charged with fire direction and control
open fire as soon as practicable. When given to a firing line, the
signal is equivalent to <span class="sans">fire at will</span>.</p>

<p><span class="sans"><a href="#BUGLE39">Cease firing</a>:</span> All parts of the line execute <span class="sans">cease firing</span> at once.</p>

<p>These signals are not used by units smaller than a regiment, except

<h4><span class="sans">MANUAL OF ARMS.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_74"><b>74.</b></a> As soon as practicable the recruit is taught the use, nomenclature
(<a href="#PLATE_I">Pl. I</a>), and care of his rifle; when fair progress has been made in
the instruction without arms, he is taught the manual of arms;
instruction without arms and that with arms alternate.</p>

<p><b><a name="para_75" href="#APPENDIX_A">75.</a></b> The following rules govern the carrying of the piece:</p>

<p>First. The piece is not carried with cartridges in either the chamber
or the magazine except when specifically ordered. When so loaded, or
supposed to be loaded, it is habitually carried locked; that is, with
the <span class="sans">safety lock</span> turned to the &quot;safe.&quot; At all other times it is
carried unlocked, with the trigger pulled.</p>

<p>Second. Whenever troops are formed under arms, pieces are immediately
inspected at the commands: 1. <span class="sans">Inspection</span>, 2. <span class="sans">ARMS</span>; 3. <span class="sans">Order
(Right shoulder, port)</span>, 4. <span class="sans">ARMS</span>.</p>

<p>A similar inspection is made immediately before dismissal.</p>

<p>If cartridges are found in the chamber or magazine they are removed
and placed in the belt.</p>

<p>Third. The cut-off is kept turned &quot;off&quot; except when cartridges are
actually used.</p>

<p>Fourth. The bayonet is not fixed except in bayonet exercise, on guard,
or for combat.</p>

<p>Fifth. <span class="sans">Fall in</span> is executed with the piece at the order arms. <span class="sans">Fall
out</span>, <span class="sans">rest</span>, and <span class="sans">at ease</span> are executed as without arms. On resuming
<span class="sans">attention</span> the position of order arms is taken.</p>

<p>Sixth. If at the order, unless otherwise prescribed, the piece is
brought to the right shoulder at the command <span class="sans">march</span>, the three
motions corresponding with the first three steps. Movements may be
executed at the trail by prefacing the preparatory command with the
words <span class="sans">at trail</span>; as, 1. <span class="sans">At trail, forward</span>, 2. <span class="sans">MARCH</span>; the trail is
taken at the command <span class="sans">march</span>.</p>

<p>When the facings, alignments, open and close ranks, taking interval or
distance, and assemblings are executed from the order, raise the piece
to the trail while in motion and resume the order on halting.</p>

<p>Seventh. The piece is brought to the order on halting. The execution
of the order begins when the halt is completed.</p>

<p>Eighth. A disengaged hand in double time is held as when without
arms.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg&#160;31]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="para_76"><b>76.</b></a> The following rules govern the execution of the manual of arms:</p>

<p>First. In all positions of the left hand at the balance (center of
gravity, bayonet unfixed) the thumb clasps the piece; the sling is
included in the grasp of the hand.</p>

<p>Second. In all positions of the piece &quot;diagonally across the body&quot; the
position of the piece, left arm and hand are the same as in port arms.</p>

<p>Third. In resuming the order from any position in the manual, the
motion next to the last concludes with the butt of the piece about 3
inches from the ground, barrel to the rear, the left hand above and
near the right, steadying the piece, fingers extended and joined,
forearm and wrist straight and inclining downward, all fingers of the
right hand grasping the piece. To complete the order, lower the piece
gently to the ground with the right hand, drop the left quickly by the
side, and take the position of order arms.</p>

<p>Allowing the piece to drop through the right hand to the ground, or
other similar abuse of the rifle to produce effect in executing the
manual, is prohibited.</p>

<p>Fourth. The cadence of the motions is that of quick time; the recruits
are first required to give their whole attention to the details of the
motions, the cadence being gradually acquired as they become
accustomed to handling their pieces. The instructor may require them
to count aloud in cadence with the motions.</p>

<p>Fifth. The manual is taught at a halt and the movements are, for the
purpose of instruction, divided into motions and executed in detail;
in this case the command of <span class="sans">execution</span> determines the prompt
execution of the first motion, and the commands, <span class="sans">two</span>, <span class="sans">three</span>,
<span class="sans">four</span>, that of the other motions.</p>

<p>To execute the movements in detail, the instructor first cautions: <span class="sans">By
the numbers</span>; all movements divided into motions are then executed as
above explained until he cautions: <span class="sans">Without the numbers</span>; or commands
movements other than those in the manual of arms.</p>

<p>Sixth. Whenever circumstances require, the regular positions of the
manual of arms and the firings may be ordered without regard to the
previous position of the piece.</p>

<p>Under exceptional conditions of weather or fatigue the rifle may be
carried in any manner directed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg&#160;32]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="sans">THE USE OF COVER.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_152"><b>152.</b></a> The recruit should be given careful instruction in the individual
use of cover.</p>

<p>It should be impressed upon him that, in taking advantage of natural
cover, he must be able to tire easily and effectively upon the enemy;
if advancing on an enemy, he must do so steadily and as rapidly as
possible; he must conceal himself as much as possible while firing and
while advancing. While setting his sight he should be under cover or
lying prone.</p>

<p><a name="para_153"><b>153.</b></a> To teach him to fire easily and effectively, at the same time
concealing himself from the view of the enemy, he is practiced in
simulated firing in the prone, sitting, kneeling, and crouching
positions, from behind hillocks, trees, heaps of earth or rocks, from
depressions, gullies, ditches, doorways, or windows. He is taught to
fire around the right side of his conceal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg&#160;48]</a></span>ment whenever possible, or,
when this is not possible, to rise enough to fire over the top of his
concealment.</p>

<p>When these details are understood, he is required to select cover with
reference to an assumed enemy and to place himself behind it in proper
position for firing.</p>

<p><a name="para_154"><b>154.</b></a> The evil of remaining too long in one place, however good the
concealment, should be explained. He should be taught to advance from
cover to cover, selecting cover in advance before leaving his
concealment.</p>

<p>It should be impressed upon him that a man running rapidly toward an
enemy furnishes a poor target. He should be trained in springing from
a prone position behind concealment, running at top speed to cover and
throwing himself behind it. He should also be practiced in advancing
from cover to cover by crawling, or by lying on the left side, rifle
grasped in the right hand, and pushing himself forward with the right
leg.</p>

<p><a name="para_155"><b>155.</b></a> He should be taught that, when fired on while acting
independently, he should drop to the ground, seek cover, and then
endeavor to locate his enemy.</p>

<p><a name="para_156"><b>156.</b></a> The instruction of the recruit in the use of cover is continued
in the combat exercises of the company, but he must then be taught
that the proper advance of the platoon or company and the
effectiveness of its fire is of greater importance than the question
of cover for individuals. He should also be taught that he may not
move about or shift his position in the firing line except the better
to see the target.</p>


<h4><span class="sans">OBSERVATION.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_157"><b>157.</b></a> The ability to use his eyes accurately is of great importance to
the soldier. The recruit should be trained in observing his
surrounding from positions and when on the march.</p>

<p>He should be practiced in pointing out and naming military features of
the ground; in distinguishing between living beings; in counting
distant groups of objects or beings; in recognizing colors and forms.</p>

<p><a name="para_158"><b>158.</b></a> In the training of men in the mechanism of the firing line, they
should be practiced in repeating to one another target and aiming
point designations and in quickly locating and pointing out a
designated target. They should be taught to distinguish, from a prone
position, distant objects, particularly troops, both with the naked
eye and with field glasses. Similarly, they should be trained in
estimating distances.</p>

<p><a name="para_212"><b>212.</b></a> The advance of a company into an engagement (whether for attack
or defense) is conducted in close order, preferably column of squads,
until the probability of encountering hostile fire makes it advisable
to deploy. After deployment, and before opening fire, the advance of
the company may be continued in skirmish line or other suitable
formation, depending upon circumstances. The advance may often be
facilitated, or better advantage taken of cover, or losses reduced by
the employment of the <span class="sans">platoon</span> or <span class="sans">squad columns</span> or by the use of a
<span class="sans">succession of thin lines</span>. The selection of the method to be used is
made by the captain or major, the choice depending upon conditions
arising during the progress of the advance. If the deployment is found
to be premature, it will generally be best to assemble the company and
proceed in close order.</p>

<p>Patrols are used to provide the necessary security against surprise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg&#160;62]</a></span></p>

<p>The platoon leaders move forward through the center of their
respective platoons; men to the right of the platoon leader march to
the left and follow him in file; those to the left march in like
manner to the right; each platoon lender thus conducts the march of
his platoon in double column of files; platoon guides follow in rear
of their respective platoons to insure prompt and orderly execution of
the advance.</p>

<p><a name="para_214"><b>214.</b></a> Being in skirmish line: 1. <span class="sans">Squad columns</span>, 2. <span class="sans">MARCH</span>.</p>

<p>The platoon or squad leaders signal <span class="sans">assemble</span>. The men of each
platoon or squad, as the case may be, advance and, moving to the right
and left, take their proper places in line, each unit assembling on
the leading element of the column and re-forming in line. The platoon
or squad leaders conduct their units toward the element or point
indicated by the captain, and to their places in line; the company is
re-formed in line.</p>

<p><a name="para_218"><b>218.</b></a> Being in skirmish line, to advance by a succession of thin lines:
1. <span class="sans">(Such numbers), forward</span>, 2. <span class="sans">MARCH</span>.</p>

<p>The captain points out in advance the selected position in front of
the line occupied. The designated number of each squad moves to the
front; the line thus formed preserves the original intervals as nearly
as practicable; when this line has advanced a suitable distance
(generally from 100 to 250 yards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg&#160;63]</a></span> depending upon the terrain and the
character of the hostile fire), a second is sent forward by similar
commands, and so on at irregular distances until the whole line has
advanced. Upon arriving at the indicated position, the first line is
halted. Successive lines, upon arriving, halt on line with the first
and the men take their proper places in the skirmish line.</p>

<p>Ordinarily each line is made up of one man per squad and the men of a
squad are sent forward in order from right to left as deployed. The
first line is led by the platoon leader of the right platoon, the
second by the guide of the right platoon, and so on in order from
right to left.</p>

<p>The advance is conducted in quick time unless conditions demand a
faster gait.</p>

<p>The company having arrived at the indicated position, a further
advance by the same means may be advisable.</p>

<p><a name="para_219"><b>219.</b></a> The advance in a succession of thin lines is used to cross a wide
stretch swept, or likely to be swept, by artillery fire or heavy,
long-range rifle fire which can not profitably be returned. Its
purpose is the building up of a strong skirmish line preparatory to
engaging in a fire fight. This method of advancing results in serious
(though temporary) loss of control over the company. Its advantage
lies in the fact that it offers a less definite target, hence is less
likely to draw fire.</p>

<p><a name="para_220"><b>220.</b></a> The above are suggestions. Other and better formations may be
devised to fit particular cases. The best formation is the one which
advances the line farthest with the least loss of men, time, and

are considered in the <a href="#SCHOOL_OF_THE_BATTALION">School of the Battalion</a>.</p>

<p>When it becomes impracticable for the company to advance as a whole by
ordinary means, it advances by rushes.</p>

<p><a name="para_222"><b>222.</b></a> Being in skirmish line: 1. <span class="sans">By platoon</span> (<span class="sans">two platoons, squad,
four men</span>, etc.), <span class="sans">from the right (left)</span>, 2. <span class="sans">RUSH</span>.</p>

<p>The platoon leader on the indicated flank carefully arranges the
details for a prompt and vigorous execution of the rush and puts it
into effect as soon as practicable. If necessary, he designates the
leader for the indicated fraction. When about to rush, he causes the
men of the fraction to cease firing and to hold themselves flat, but
in readiness to spring forward in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg&#160;64]</a></span>stantly. The leader of the rush (at
the signal of the platoon leader, if the latter be not the leader of
the rush) commands: <span class="sans">Follow me</span>, and, running at top speed, leads the
fraction to the new line, where he halts it and causes it to open
fire. The leader of the rush selects the new line if it has not been
previously designated.</p>

<p>The first fraction having established itself on the new line, the next
like fraction is sent forward by its platoon leader, without further
command of the captain, and so on, successively, until the entire
company is on the line established by the first rush.</p>

<p>If more than one platoon is to join in one rush, the junior platoon
leader conforms to the action of the senior.</p>

<p>A part of the line having advanced, the captain may increase or
decrease the size of the fractions to complete the movement.</p>

<p><a name="para_223"><b>223.</b></a> When the company forms a part of the firing line, the rush of the
company as a whole is conducted by the captain, as described for a
platoon in the <a href="#para_222">preceding paragraph</a>. The captain leads the rush;
platoon leaders lead their respective platoons; platoon guides follow
the line to insure prompt and orderly execution of the advance.</p>

<p><a name="para_224"><b>224.</b></a> When the foregoing method of rushing, by running, becomes

<h4><span class="sans">The Company in Support.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_225"><b>225.</b></a> To enable it to follow or reach the firing line, the support
adopts suitable formations, following the principles explained in
paragraphs <a href="#para_212">212&#8211;218</a>.</p>

<p>The support should be kept assembled as long as practicable. If after
deploying a favorable opportunity arises to hold it for some time in
close formation, it should be reassembled. It is redeployed when
necessary.</p>

<p><a name="para_226"><b>226.</b></a> The movements of the support as a whole and the dispatch of
reenforcements from it to the firing line are controlled by the major.</p>

<p>A reenforcement of less than one platoon has little influence and will
be avoided whenever practicable.</p>

<p>The captain of a company in support is constantly on the alert for the
major's signals or commands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg&#160;65]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="para_227"><b>227.</b></a> A reenforcement sent to the firing line joins it deployed as
skirmishers. The leader of the reenforcement places it in an interval
in the line, if one exists, and commands it thereafter as a unit. If
no such suitable interval exists, the reenforcement is advanced with
increased intervals between skirmishers; each man occupies the nearest
interval in the firing line, and each then obeys the orders of the
nearest squad leader and platoon leader.</p>

<p><a name="para_228"><b>228.</b></a> A reenforcement joins the firing line as quickly as possible
without exhausting the men.</p>

<p><a name="para_229"><b>229.</b></a> The original platoon division of the companies in the firing line
should be maintained and should not be broken up by the mingling of
reenforcements.</p>

<p>Upon joining the firing line, officers and sergeants accompanying a
reenforcement take over the duties of others of like grade who have
been disabled, or distribute themselves so as best to exercise their
normal functions. Conditions will vary and no rules can be prescribed.
It is essential that all assist in mastering the increasing
difficulties of control.</p>


<h4><span class="sans">The Company Acting Alone.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_230"><b>230.</b></a> In general, the company, when acting alone, is employed according
to the principles applicable to the battalion acting alone; the
captain employs platoons as the major employs companies, making due
allowance for the difference in strength.</p>

<p>The support may be smaller in proportion or may be dispensed with.</p>

<p><a name="para_231"><b>231.</b></a> The company must be well protected against surprise. Combat
patrols on the flanks are specially important. Each leader of a flank

<p><a name="para_234"><b>234.</b></a> The voice is generally inadequate for giving commands during fire

<h4><span class="sans">Classes of Firing.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_241"><b>241.</b></a> <span class="sans">Volley firing</span> has limited application. In defense it may be
used in the early stages of the action if the enemy presents a large,
compact target. It may be used by troops executing <span class="sans">fire of position</span>.
When the ground near the target is such that the strike of bullets can
be seen from the firing line, <span class="sans">ranging volleys</span> may be used to correct
the sight setting.</p>

<p>In combat, volley firing is executed habitually by platoon.</p>

<p><a name="para_242"><b>242.</b></a> <span class="sans">Fire at will</span> is the class of fire normally employed in attack
or defense.</p>

<p><a name="para_243"><b>243.</b></a> <span class="sans">Clip fire</span> has limited application. It is principally used: 1.
In the early stages of combat, to steady the men by habituating them
to brief pauses in firing. 2. To produce a short burst of fire.</p>


<h4><span class="sans">The Target.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_244"><b>244.</b></a> Ordinarily the major will assign to the company an objective in
attack or sector in defense; the company's target will lie within the
limits so assigned. In the choice of target, tactical considerations
are paramount; the nearest hostile troops within the objective or
sector will thus be the usual target. This will ordinarily be the
hostile firing line; troops in rear are ordinarily proper targets for
artillery, machine guns, or, at times, infantry employing fire of
position.</p>

<p>Change of target should not be made without excellent reasons
therefor, such as the sudden appearance of hostile troops under
conditions which make them more to be feared than the troops
comprising the former target.</p>

<p><a name="para_245"><b>245.</b></a> The distribution of fire over the entire target is of special
importance.</p>

<p>The captain allots a part of the target to each platoon, or each
platoon leader takes as his target that part which corresponds to his
position in the company. Men are so instructed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg&#160;68]</a></span> that each fires on
that part of the target which is directly opposite him.</p>

<p><a name="para_246"><b>246.</b></a> All parts of the target are equally important. Care must be
exercised that the men do not slight its less visible parts. A section
of the target not covered by fire represents a number of the enemy
permitted to fire coolly and effectively.</p>

<p><a name="para_247"><b>247.</b></a> If the target can not be seen with the naked eye, platoon leaders
select an object in front of or behind it, designate this as the
<span class="sans">aiming target</span>, and direct a sight setting which will carry the cone
of fire into the target.</p>

<p>(<i>C.I.D.R., No. 17.</i>)</p>


<h4><span class="sans">Fire Direction.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_248"><b>248.</b></a> When the company is large enough to be divided into platoons, it
is impracticable for the captain to command it directly in combat. His
efficiency in managing the firing line is measured by his ability to
enforce his will through the platoon leaders. Having indicated clearly
what he desires them to do, he avoids interfering except to correct
serious errors or omissions.</p>

<p><a name="para_249"><b>249.</b></a> The captain <span class="sans">directs</span> the fire of the company or of designated
platoons. He designates the target, and, when practicable, allots a
part of the target to each platoon. Before beginning the fire action
he determines the range, announces the sight setting, and indicates
the class of fire to be employed and the time to open fire.
Thereafter, he observes the fire effect, corrects material errors in
sight setting, prevents exhaustion of the ammunition supply, and
causes the distribution of such extra ammunition as may be received
from the rear.</p>


<h4><span class="sans">Fire Control.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_250"><b>250.</b></a> In combat the platoon is the <span class="sans">fire unit</span>. From 20 to 35 rifles
are as many as one leader can control effectively.</p>

<p><a name="para_251"><b>251.</b></a> Each platoon leader puts into execution the commands or
directions of the captain, having first taken such precautions to
insure correct sight setting and clear description of the target or
aiming target as the situation permits or requires; thereafter, he
gives such additional commands or directions as are necessary to exact
compliance with the captain's will. He corrects the sight setting when
necessary. He designates an aiming target when the target can not be
seen with the naked eye.</p>

<p>(<i>C.I.D.R., No. 17.</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg&#160;69]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="para_252"><b>252.</b></a> In general, <span class="sans">platoon leaders</span> observe the target and the effect
of their fire and are on the alert for the captain's commands or
signals; they observe and regulate the rate of fire. The <span class="sans">platoon
guides</span> watch the firing line and check every breach of fire
discipline. <span class="sans">Squad leaders</span> transmit commands and signals when
necessary, observe the conduct of their squads and abate excitement,
assist in enforcing fire discipline and participate in the firing.</p>

<p><a name="para_253"><b>253.</b></a> The best troops are those that submit longest to fire control.
Loss of control is an evil which robs success of its greatest results.
To avoid or delay such loss should be the constant aim of all.</p>

<p>Fire control implies the ability to stop firing, change the sight
setting and target, and resume a well directed fire.</p>


<h4><span class="sans">Fire Discipline.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_254"><b>254.</b></a> &quot;Fire discipline implies, besides a habit of obedience, a control
of the rifle by the soldier, the result of training, which will enable
him in action to make hits instead of misses. It embraces taking
advantage of the ground; care in setting the sight and delivery of
fire; constant attention to the orders of the leaders, and careful
observation of the enemy; an increase of fire when the target is
favorable, and a cessation of fire when the enemy disappears; economy
of ammunition.&quot; (Small-Arms Firing Manual.)</p>

<p>In combat, shots which graze the enemy's trench or position and thus
reduce the effectiveness of his fire have the approximate value of
hits; such shots only, or actual hits, contribute toward fire
superiority.</p>

<p>Fire discipline implies that, in a firing line without leaders, each
man retains his presence of mind and directs effective fire upon the
proper target.</p>

<p><a name="para_255"><b>255.</b></a> To create a correct appreciation of the requirements of fire
discipline, men are taught that the rate of fire should be as rapid as
is consistent with accurate aiming; that the rate will depend upon the
visibility, proximity, and size of the target; and that the proper
rate will ordinarily suggest itself to each trained man, usually
rendering cautions or commands unnecessary.</p>

<p>In attack the highest rate of fire is employed at the halt preceding
the assault, and in pursuing fire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg&#160;70]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="para_256"><b>256.</b></a> In an advance by rushes, leaders of troops in firing positions
are responsible for the delivery of heavy fire to cover the advance of
each rushing fraction. Troops are trained to change slightly the
direction of fire so as not to endanger the flanks of advanced
portions of the firing line.</p>

<p><a name="para_257"><b>257.</b></a> In defense, when the target disappears behind cover, platoon
leaders suspend fire, prepare their platoons to fire upon the point
where it is expected to reappear, and greet its reappearance instantly
with vigorous fire.</p>

<h3><a name="COMBAT_PRINCIPLES"></a>COMBAT PRINCIPLES.</h3>

<h4><span class="sans">Orders.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_290"><b>290.</b></a> The following references to orders are applicable to attack or
defense.</p>

<p><a name="para_291"><b>291.</b></a> In extended order, the company is the largest unit to execute
movements by prescribed commands or means. The major, assembling his
captains if practicable, directs the disposition of the battalion by
means of <span class="sans">tactical orders</span>. He controls its subsequent movements by
such <span class="sans">orders</span> or <span class="sans">commands</span> as are suitable to the occasion.</p>

<p><a name="para_292"><b>292.</b></a> In every disposition of the battalion for combat the major's
order should give subordinates sufficient information of the enemy, of
the position of supporting and neighboring troops, and of the object
sought to enable them to conform intelligently to the general plan.</p>

<p>The order should then designate the companies which are to constitute
the <span class="sans">firing line</span> and those which are to constitute the <span class="sans">support</span>. In
attack, it should designate the direction or the objective, the order
and front of the companies on the firing line, and should designate
the right or left company as base company. In defense, it should
describe the front of each company and, if necessary, the sector to be
observed by each.</p>

<p><a name="para_293"><b>293.</b></a> When the battalion is operating alone, the major provides for the
reconnaissance and protection of his flanks; if part of a larger
force, the major makes similar provisions, when necessary, without
orders from higher authority, unless such authority has specifically
directed other suitable reconnaissance and protection.</p>

<p><a name="para_294"><b>294.</b></a> When the battalion is deployed upon the initiative of the major,
he will indicate whether extra ammunition shall be issued; if deployed
in pursuance of orders of higher authority, the major will cause the
issue of extra ammunition, unless such authority has given directions
to the contrary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg&#160;82]</a></span></p>


<h4><span class="sans">Deployment.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_295"><b>295.</b></a> The following principles of deployment are applicable to attack
or defense.</p>

<p><a name="para_296"><b>296.</b></a> A premature deployment involves a long, disorganizing and
fatiguing advance of the skirmish line, and should be avoided. A
greater evil is to be caught by heavy fire when in dense column or
other close order formation; hence advantage should be taken of cover
in order to retain the battalion in close order formation until
exposure to heavy hostile fire may reasonably be anticipated.</p>

<p><a name="para_297"><b>297.</b></a> The major regulates the depth of the deployment and the extent
and density of the firing line, subject to such restrictions as a
senior may have imposed.</p>

<p>Companies or designated subdivisions and detachments are conducted by
their commanders in such manner as best to accomplish the mission
assigned to them under the major's orders. Companies designated for
the firing line march independently to the place of deployment, form
skirmish line, and take up the advance. They conform, in general, to
the base company.</p>

<p><a name="para_298"><b>298.</b></a> The commander of a battalion, whether it is operating alone or as
part of a larger force, should hold a part of his command out of the
firing line. By the judicious use of this force the major can exert an
influence not otherwise possible over his firing line and can control,
within reasonable limits, an action once begun. So if his battalion be
assigned to the <span class="sans">firing line</span> the major will cause one, two, or three
companies to be deployed on the firing line, retaining the remaining
companies or company as a <span class="sans">support</span> for that firing line. The division
of the battalion into firing line and support will depend upon the
front to be covered and the nature and anticipated severity of the
action.</p>

<p><a name="para_299"><b>299.</b></a> If the battalion be part of a larger command, the number of
companies in the firing line will generally be determinable from the
regimental commander's order; the remainder constitutes the support.
If the battalion is acting alone, the support must be strong enough to
maintain the original fire power of the firing line, to protect the
flanks, and to perform the functions of a reserve, whatever be the
issue of the action. See <a href="#para_346">paragraph 346</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg&#160;83]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="para_300"><b>300.</b></a> If the battalion is operating alone, the support may, according
to circumstances, be held in one or two bodies and placed behind the
center, or one or both flanks of the firing line, or echeloned beyond
a flank. If the battalion is part of a larger force, the support is
generally held in one body.</p>

<p><a name="para_301"><b>301.</b></a> The distance between the firing line and the supporting group or
groups will vary between wide limits; it should be as short as the
necessity for protection from heavy losses will permit. When cover is
available, the support should be as close as 50 to 100 yards; when
such cover is not available, it should not be closer than 300 yards.
It may be as far as 500 yards in rear if good cover is there
obtainable and is not obtainable at a lesser distance.</p>

<p><a name="para_302"><b>302.</b></a> In exceptional cases, as in a meeting engagement, it may be
necessary to place an entire battalion or regiment in the firing line
at the initial deployment, the support being furnished by other
troops. Such deployment causes the early mingling of the larger units,
thus rendering leadership and control extremely difficult. The
necessity for such deployment will increase with the inefficiency of
the commander and of the service of information.</p>


<h4><span class="sans">Fire.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_303"><b>303.</b></a> Fire direction and fire control are functions of company and
platoon commanders. The major makes the primary apportionment of the
target&#8212;in defense, by assigning sectors of fire; in attack, by
assigning the objective. In the latter case each company in the firing
line takes as its target that part of the general objective which lies
in its front.</p>

<p><a name="para_304"><b>304.</b></a> The major should indicate the point or time at which the fire
fight is to open. He may do this in his order for deployment or he may
follow the firing line close enough to do so at the proper time. If it
be impracticable for him to do either, the senior officer with the
firing line, in each battalion, selects the time for opening fire.</p>


<h4><span class="sans">Attack.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_305"><b>305.</b></a> The battalion is the <span class="sans">attack unit</span>, whether operating alone or as
part of a larger unit.</p>

<p><a name="para_306"><b>306.</b></a> If his battalion be one of several in the firing line, the major,
in executing his part of the attack, pushes his battalion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg&#160;84]</a></span> forward as
vigorously as possible within the front, or section, assigned to it.
The great degree of independence allowed to him as to details demands,
in turn, the exercise of good judgment on his part. Better leadership,
better troops, and more favorable terrain enable one battalion to
advance more rapidly in attack than another less fortunate, and such a
battalion will insure the further advance of the others. The leading
battalion should not, however, become isolated; isolation may lead to
its destruction.</p>

<p><a name="para_307"><b>307.</b></a> The deployment having been made, the firing line advances without
firing. The predominant idea must be to close with the enemy as soon
as possible without ruinous losses. The limited supply of ammunition
and the uncertainty of resupply, the necessity for securing fire
superiority in order to advance within the shorter ranges, and the
impossibility of accomplishing this at ineffective ranges, make it
imperative that fire be not opened as long as the advance can be
continued without demoralizing losses. The attack which halts to open
fire at extreme range (over 1,200 yards) is not likely ever to reach
its destination. Every effort should be made, by using cover or
inconspicuous formations, or by advancing the firing line as a whole,
to arrive within 800 yards of the enemy before opening fire.</p>

<p><a name="para_308"><b>308.</b></a> Except when the enemy's artillery is able to effect an unusual
concentration of fire, its fire upon deployed infantry causes losses
which are unimportant when compared with those inflicted by his
infantry; hence the attacking infantry should proceed to a position as
described above, and from which an effective fire can be directed
against the hostile infantry with a view to obtaining fire
superiority. The effectiveness of the enemy's fire must be reduced so
as to permit further advance. The more effective the fire to which the
enemy is subjected the less effective will be his fire.</p>

<p><a name="para_309"><b>309.</b></a> Occasionally the fire of adjacent battalions, or of infantry
employing fire of position, or of supporting artillery, will permit
the further advance of the entire firing line from this point, but it
will generally be necessary to advance by rushes of fractions of the
line.</p>

<p>The fraction making the rush should be as large as the hostile fire
and the necessity for maintaining fire superiority will permit.
Depending upon circumstances, the strength of the fraction may vary
from a company to a few men.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg&#160;85]</a></span></p>

<p>The advance is made as rapidly as possible without losing fire
superiority. The smaller the fraction which rushes, the greater the
number of rifles which continue to fire upon the enemy. On the other
hand, the smaller the fraction which rushes the slower will be the
progress of the attack.</p>

<p><a name="para_310"><b>310.</b></a> Enough rifles must continue in action to insure the success of
each rush. Frequently the successive advances of the firing line must
be effected by rushes of fractions of decreased size; that is,
advances by rushes may first be made by company, later by half company
or platoon, and finally by squads or files; but no subsequent
opportunity to <span class="sans">increase</span> the rate of advance, such as better cover or
a decrease of the hostile fire, should be overlooked.</p>

<p><a name="para_311"><b>311.</b></a> Whenever possible, the rush is begun by a flank fraction of the
firing line. In the absence of express directions from the major, each
captain of a flank company determines when an advance by rushes shall
be attempted. A flank company which inaugurates an advance by rushes
becomes the base company, if not already the base. An advance by
rushes having been inaugurated on one flank, the remainder of the
firing line conforms; fractions rush successively from that flank and
halt on the line established by the initial rush.</p>

<p>The fractions need not be uniform in size; each captain indicates how
his company shall rush, having due regard to the ground and the state
of the fire fight.</p>

<p><a name="para_312"><b>312.</b></a> A fraction about to rush is sent forward when the remainder of
the line is firing vigorously; otherwise the chief advantage of this
method of advancing is lost.</p>

<p>The length of the rush will vary from 30 to 80 yards, depending upon
the existence of cover, positions for firing, and the hostile fire.</p>

<p><a name="para_313"><b>313.</b></a> When the entire firing line of the battalion has advanced to the
new line, fresh opportunities to advance are sought as before.</p>

<p><a name="para_314"><b>314.</b></a> Two identical situations will never confront the battalion; hence
at drill it is prohibited to arrange the details of an advance before
the preceding one has been concluded, or to employ a fixed or
prearranged method of advancing by rushes.</p>

<p><a name="para_315"><b>315.</b></a> The major posts himself so as best to direct the reenforcing of
the firing line from the support. When all or nearly all of the
support has been absorbed by the firing line, he joins, and takes full
charge of, the latter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg&#160;86]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="para_316"><b>316.</b></a> The reenforcing of the firing line by driblets of a squad or a
few men has no appreciable effect. The firing line requires either no
reenforcement or a strong one. Generally one or two platoons will be
sent forward under cover of a heavy fire of the firing line.</p>

<p><a name="para_317"><b>317.</b></a> To facilitate control and to provide intervals in which
reenforcements may be placed, the companies in the firing line should
be kept closed in on their centers as they become depleted by
casualties during the advance.</p>

<p>When this is impracticable, reenforcements must mingle with and
thicken the firing line. In battle the latter method will be the rule
rather than the exception, and to familiarize the men with such
conditions the combat exercises of the battalion should include both
methods of reenforcing. Occasionally, to provide the necessary
intervals for reenforcing by either of these methods, the firing line
should be thinned by causing men to drop out and simulate losses
during the various advances. Under ordinary conditions the depletion
of the firing line for this purpose will be from one-fifth to one-half
of its strength.</p>

<p><a name="para_318"><b>318.</b></a> The major or senior officer in the firing line determines when
bayonets shall be fixed and gives the proper command or signal. It is
repeated by all parts of the firing line. Each man who was in the
front rank prior to deployment, as soon as he recognizes the command
or signal, suspends firing, quickly fixes his bayonet, and immediately
resumes firing; after which the other men suspend firing, fix
bayonets, and immediately resume firing. The support also fixes
bayonets. The concerted fixing of the bayonet by the firing line at
drill does not simulate battle conditions and should not be required.
It is essential that there be no marked pause in the firing. Bayonets
will be fixed generally before or during the last, or second last,
advance preceding the charge.</p>

<p><a name="para_319"><b>319.</b></a> Subject to orders from higher authority, the major determines the
point from which the charge is to be made. The firing line having
arrived at that point and being in readiness, the major causes the
<span class="sans"><a href="#BUGLE41">charge</a></span> to be sounded. The signal is repeated by the musicians of all
parts of the line. The company officers lead the charge. The
skirmishers spring forward shouting, run with bayonets at charge, and
close with the enemy.</p>

<p>The further conduct of the charging troops will depend upon
circumstances; they may halt and engage in bayonet combat or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg&#160;87]</a></span> in
pursuing fire; they may advance a short distance to obtain a field of
fire or to drive the enemy from the vicinity; they may assemble or
reorganize, etc. If the enemy vacates his position every effort should
be made to open fire at once on the retreating mass, reorganization of
the attacking troops being of secondary importance to the infliction
of further losses upon the enemy and to the increase of his confusion.
In combat exercises the major will assume a situation and terminate
the assault accordingly.</p>


<h4><span class="sans">Defense.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_320"><b>320.</b></a> In defense, as in attack, the battalion is the tactical unit best
suited to independent assignment. Defensive positions are usually
divided into sections and a battalion assigned to each.</p>

<p><a name="para_321"><b>321.</b></a> The major locates such fire, communicating, and cover trenches
and obstacles as are to be constructed. He assigns companies to
construct them and details the troops to occupy them.</p>

<p><a name="para_322"><b>322.</b></a> The major reenforces the firing line in accordance with the
principles applicable to, and explained in connection with, the
attack, maintaining no more rifles in the firing line than are
necessary to prevent the enemy's advance.</p>

<p><a name="para_323"><b>323.</b></a> The supply of ammunition being usually ample, fire is opened as
soon as it is possible to break up the enemy's formation, stop his
advance, or inflict material loss, but this rule must be modified to
suit the ammunition supply.</p>

<p><a name="para_324"><b>324.</b></a> The major causes the firing line and support to fix bayonets when
an assault by the enemy is imminent. Captains direct this to be done
if they are not in communication with the major and the measure is
deemed advisable.</p>

<p>Fire alone will not stop a determined, skillfully conducted attack.
The defender must have equal tenacity; if he can stay in his trench or
position and cross bayonets, he will at least have neutralized the
hostile first line, and the combat will be decided by reserves.</p>

<p><a name="para_325"><b>325.</b></a> If ordered or compelled to withdraw under hostile infantry fire
or in the presence of hostile infantry, the support will be posted so
as to cover the retirement of the firing line.</p>

<p><a name="para_326"><b>326.</b></a> When the battalion is operating alone, the support must be strong
and must be fed sparingly into the firing line, especially if a
counterattack is planned. Opportunities for counterattack should be
sought at all times.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg&#160;88]</a></span></p>

their respective commanders.</p>

<p><a name="para_329"><b>329.</b></a> The colonel either gives his commands or orders orally, by bugle,
or by signal, or communicates them by staff officers or orderlies.</p>

<p>Each major gives the appropriate commands or orders, and, in
close-order movements, causes his battalion to execute the necessary
movements at his command of execution. Each major ordinarily moves his
battalion from one formation to another, in column of squads, in the
most convenient manner, and, in the presence of the enemy, in the most
direct manner consistent with cover.</p>

<p>Commanders of the special units observe the same principles as to
commands and movements. They take places in the new formation as
directed by the colonel; in the absence of such directions they
conform as nearly as practicable to <a href="#PLATE_IV">Plate IV</a>, maintaining their
relative positions with respect to the flank or end of the regiment on
which they are originally posted.</p>

<p><a name="para_330"><b>330.</b></a> When the regiment is formed, and during ceremonies, the

<p><a name="para_333"><b>333.</b></a> Unless otherwise directed, the battalions are posted from right
to left, or from head to rear, according to the rank of the battalion
commanders present, the senior on the right or at the head. A
battalion whose major is in command of the regiment retains its place.</p>

<p><a name="para_334"><b>334.</b></a> For ordinary purposes, the regiment is formed in column of squads
or in column of masses.</p>

<p>The adjutant informs the majors what the formation is to be. The
battalions and special units having been formed, he posts himself and
draws saber. <span class="sans"><a href="#BUGLE10">Adjutant's call</a></span> is sounded, or the adjutant signals
<span class="sans">assemble</span>.</p>

<p>If forming in column of squads, the adjutant posts himself so as to be
facing the column when formed, and 6 paces in front of the place to be
occupied by the leading guide of the regiment; if forming in column of
masses, he posts himself so as to be facing the right guides of the
column when formed, and 6 paces in front of the place to be occupied
by the right guide of the leading company. Later, he moves so as best
to observe the formation.</p>

<p>The battalions are halted, at attention, in column of squads or close
column, as the case may be, successively from the front in their
proper order and places. The band takes its place when the leading
battalion has halted. Other special units take their places in turn
when the rear battalion has halted.</p>

<p>The majors and the commanders of the machine-gun company and mounted
scouts (or detachment) each, when his command is in place, salutes the
adjutant and commands: <span class="sans">At ease</span>; the adjutant returns the salutes.
When all have saluted and the band is in place, the adjutant rides to
the colonel, reports: <span class="sans">Sir, the regiment is formed</span>, and takes his
post. The colonel draws saber.</p>

<p>The formation in column of squads may be modified to the extent
demanded by circumstances. Prior to the formation the adjutant
indicates the point where the head of the column is to rest and the
direction in which it is to face: he then posts himself so as best to
observe the formation. At <span class="sans"><a href="#BUGLE10">adjutant's call</a></span> or <span class="sans">assemble</span> the leading
battalion marches to, and halts at, the indicated point. The other
battalions take positions from which they may conveniently follow in
their proper places.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg&#160;91]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="para_335"><b>335.</b></a> For ceremonies, or when directed, the regiment is formed in line
or line of masses.</p>

<p>The adjutant posts himself so as to be 6 paces to the right of the
right or leading company of the right battalion when the regiment is
formed and faces in the direction in which the line is to extend.
<span class="sans"><a href="#BUGLE10">Adjutant's call</a></span> is sounded; the band plays.</p>

<p>The adjutant indicates to the adjutant of the right battalion the
point of rest and the direction in which the line is to extend, and
then takes post facing the regiment midway between the post of the
colonel and the center of the regiment. Each of the other battalion
adjutants precedes his battalion to the line and marks its point of
rest.</p>

<p>The battalions, arriving from the rear, each in line or close column,
as the case may be, are halted on the line successively from right to
left in their proper order and places. Upon halting, each major
commands: 1. <span class="sans">Right</span>, 2. <span class="sans">DRESS</span>. The battalion adjutant assists in
aligning the battalion and then takes his post.</p>

<p>The band, arriving from the rear, takes its place in line when the
right battalion has halted; it ceases playing when the left battalion
has halted. The machine-gun company and the mounted scouts (or
detachment) take their places in line after the center battalion has
halted.</p>

<p>The colonel and those who accompany him take post.</p>

<p>When all parts of the line have been dressed, and officers and all
others have reached their posts, the adjutant commands: 1. <span class="sans">Present</span>,
2. <span class="sans">ARMS</span>. He then turns about and reports to the colonel: <span class="sans">Sir, the
regiment is formed</span>; the colonel directs the adjutant: <span class="sans">Take your
post, Sir</span>, draws saber and brings the regiment to the order. The
adjutant takes his post, passing to the right of the colonel.</p>

in the formation best suited to its subsequent tactical employment.</p>

<p><a name="para_340"><b>340.</b></a> To assume any formation, the colonel indicates to the majors the
character of the formation desired, the order of the battalions, and
the point of rest. Each battalion is conducted by its major, and is
placed in its proper order in the formation, by the most convenient
means and route.</p>

<p>Having halted in a formation, no movements for the purpose of
correcting minor discrepancies in alignments, intervals, or distances
are made unless specially directed by the colonel or necessitated by
conditions of cover.</p>

<p><a name="para_341"><b>341.</b></a> To correct intervals, distances, and alignments, the colonel
directs one or more of the majors to rectify their battalions. Each
major so directed causes his battalion to correct its alignment,

formation.</p>


<h3><a name="COMBAT_PRINCIPLES2"></a>COMBAT PRINCIPLES.</h3>

<p><a name="para_342"><b>342.</b></a> The regiment is deployed by the colonel's order to the commanders
of battalions and special units. The order should give them
information of the situation and of the proposed plan of action. In
attack, the order should assign to each battalion not in reserve its
objective or line of advance. In defense, it should assign to each its
sector. In either case it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg&#160;93]</a></span> should designate the troops for, and the
position of, the reserve and prescribe the employment of the machine
guns and mounted scouts.</p>

<p>Both in attack and defense the order may fix the front to be covered
in the deployment.</p>

<p>Encroachment upon the proper functions of subordinates and unnecessary
details should be studiously avoided. When the regiment deploys, the
colonel habitually places the band at the disposal of the surgeon for
employment in caring for the wounded. (<i>C.I.D.R., No. 2.</i>)</p>

<p><a name="para_343"><b>343.</b></a> The regiment, when operating alone and attacking, should
undertake an enveloping attack if it does not result in overextension.</p>

<p>Assuming a regiment of 1,500 rifles, an extension of more than 1,000
yards between its extreme flanks when making an enveloping attack
alone is seldom justifiable; when part of a battle line, a front of
500 yards can rarely be exceeded.</p>

<p><a name="para_344"><b>344.</b></a> In defense the front occupied when acting alone or posted on or
near the flank of a battle line should seldom exceed 600 yards; when
posted as an interior regiment, the front may be increased to 800
yards. The front may be somewhat longer than in the attack, since
smaller battalion supports are justifiable. When the regiment is
operating alone, however, the regimental reserve should be as strong
in the defense as in the attack unless the flanks are secure.</p>

<p><a name="para_345"><b>345.</b></a> The colonel should always hold out a reserve&#8212;generally one
battalion; but when the regiment is operating alone, it is generally
advisable to hold out more at first.</p>

<p><a name="para_346"><b>346.</b></a> Whereas the support held out in each battalion of the firing line
is intended to thicken the diminishing firing line at the proper times
and sometimes to lengthen it, the reserve held out in a regiment
operating alone is used for this purpose only as a last resort. Its
primary functions are: In attack, to protect the flanks, to improve
fully the advantage following a victory, or to cover defeat; in
defense, to prolong the firing line, to effect a counterattack, or to
cover withdrawal. It is the colonel's chief means of influencing an
action once begun. It should be conserved to await the proper moment
for its employment; the combat will seldom come to a successful issue
without its employment in some form.</p>

<p>The reserve of a regiment operating as part of a large force becomes a
local reserve. It replaces depleted supports and in attack strengthens
and protects the firing line in the charge.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_BRIGADE" id="THE_BRIGADE"></a>THE BRIGADE.</h2>


<p><a name="para_347"><b>347.</b></a> The brigade does not engage in prescribed drills. It engages in
route marches and battle or other tactical exercises. These are
conducted pursuant to commands or orders formulated to suit the
conditions of the proposed movement or exercise, and, in general, in
accordance with the principles applicable to the regiment.</p>

<p><a name="para_348"><b>348.</b></a> A brigade of about 4,000 rifles, as part of a general battle
line, would be deployed on a front of not more than 1,200 yards in
attack or 1,600 yards in defense.</p>

<p>When acting alone the distance between extreme flanks in an enveloping
attack should not exceed 2,000 yards at the time the attacking
infantry opens fire.</p>

<p>When acting alone, the front in defense should not exceed 1,600 yards.</p>

<p>These limits apply to the original deployment of the brigade for
combat and presuppose an enemy of equal or nearly equal training and
morale. The limits necessitated by the subsequent progress of the
combat can not be foreseen.</p>

<p><a name="para_350"><b>350.</b></a> Part II of these regulations treats only of the basic principles
of combat tactics as applied to infantry and to the special units,
such as machine guns and mounted scouts, which form a part of infantry
regiments and battalions.</p>

<p>The combat tactics of the arms combined are considered in Field
Service Regulations.</p>

<p><a name="para_351"><b>351.</b></a> Modern combat demands the highest order of training, discipline,
leadership, and morale on the part of the infantry. Complicated
maneuvers are impracticable; efficient leadership and a determination
to win by simple and direct methods must be depended upon for success.</p>

<p><a name="para_352"><b>352.</b></a> The duties of infantry are many and difficult. All infantry must
be fit to cope with all conditions that may arise. Modern war requires
but one kind of infantry&#8212;good infantry.</p>

<p><a name="para_353"><b>353.</b></a> The infantry must take the offensive to gain decisive results.
Both sides are therefore likely to attempt it, though not necessarily
at the same time or in the same part of a long battle line.</p>

<p>In the local combats which make up the general battle the better
endurance, use of ground, fire efficiency, discipline, and training
will win. It is the duty of the infantry to win the local successes
which enable the commanding general to win the battle.</p>

<p><a name="para_354"><b>354.</b></a> The infantry must have the tenacity to hold every advantage
gained, the individual and collective discipline and skill needed to
master the enemy's fire, the determination to close with the enemy in
attack, and to meet him with the bayonet in defense. Infantry must be
trained to bear the heaviest burdens and losses, both of combat and
march.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg&#160;96]</a></span></p>

<p>Good infantry can defeat an enemy greatly superior in numbers, but
lacking in training, discipline, leadership, and morale.</p>

<p><a name="para_355"><b>355.</b></a> It is impossible to establish fixed forms or to give general
instructions that will cover all cases. Officers and noncommissioned
officers must be so trained that they can apply suitable means and
methods to each case as it arises. Study and practice are necessary to
acquire proper facility in this respect. Theoretical instruction can
not replace practical instruction; the former supplies correct ideas
and gives to practical work an interest, purpose, and definiteness not
otherwise obtainable.</p>

<p><a name="para_356"><b>356.</b></a> After the mechanism of extended order drill has been learned with
precision in the company, every exercise should be, as far as
practicable, in the nature of a maneuver (combat exercise) against an
<span class="sans">imaginary</span>, <span class="sans">outlined</span>, or <span class="sans">represented</span> enemy.</p>

<p>Company extended order drill may be conducted without reference to a
tactical situation, but a combat exercise, whatever may be the size of
the unit employed, should be conducted under an assumed tactical
situation.</p>

<p><a name="para_357"><b>357.</b></a> An effective method of conducting a combat exercise is to outline
the enemy with a few men equipped with flags. The umpire or inspector
states the situation and the commander leads his troops with due
regard to the assumptions made.</p>

<p>Changes in the situation, the results of reconnaissance, the character
of artillery fire, etc., are made known to the commander when
necessary by the umpire or inspector, who, in order to observe and
influence the conduct of the exercise, remains in rear of the firing
line. From this position he indicates, with the aid of prearranged
signals, the character of the fire and movements of the hostile
infantry. These signals are intended for the men outlining the enemy.
These men repeat the signals; all officers and men engaged in the
exercise and in sight of the outlined enemy are thus informed of the
enemy's action and the exercise is conducted accordingly.</p>

<p>Assistant umpires, about one for each company in the firing line, may
assist in indicating hostile fire and movements and in observing the
conduct of the exercise.</p>

<p>An outlined enemy may be made to attack or defend.</p>

<p>Situations should be simple and natural. During or after the exercise
the umpire or inspector should call attention to any improper
movements or incorrect methods of execution. He will prohibit all
movements of troops or individuals that would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg&#160;97]</a></span> be impossible if the
enemy were real. The slow progress of events to be expected on the
battle field can hardly be simulated, but the umpire or inspector will
prevent undue haste and will attempt to enforce a reasonably slow rate
of progress.</p>

<p>The same exercise should not be repeated over the same ground and
under the same situation. Such repetitions lead to the adoption of a
fixed mode of attack or defense and develop mere drill masters. Fixed
or prearranged systems are prohibited.</p>

<h4><span class="sans"><a name="GENERAL_CONSIDERATIONS"></a>General Considerations.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_358"><b>358.</b></a> The art of leadership consists of applying sound tactical

<p>Self-reliance, initiative, aggressiveness, and a conception of
teamwork are the fundamental characteristics of successful leadership.</p>

<p><a name="para_359"><b>359.</b></a> A correct grasp of the situation and a definite plan of action

details in the original plan.</p>

<p><a name="para_360"><b>360.</b></a> Combats that do not promise success or some real advantage to the

<p><a name="para_361"><b>361.</b></a> Complicated maneuvers are not likely to succeed in war. All plans
and the methods adopted for carrying them into effect must be simple
and direct.</p>

<p><a name="para_362"><b>362.</b></a> Order and cohesion must be maintained within the units if success
is to be expected.</p>

<p><a name="para_363"><b>363.</b></a> Officers must show themselves to be true leaders. They must act
in accordance with the spirit of their orders and must require of
their troops the strictest discipline on the field of battle.</p>

<p><a name="para_364"><b>364.</b></a> The best results are obtained when leaders know the capacity and
traits of those whom they command; hence in making detachments units
should not be broken up, and a deployment that would cause an
intermingling of the larger units in the firing line should be
avoided.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg&#160;98]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="para_365"><b>365.</b></a> Leading is difficult when troops are deployed. A high degree of
training and discipline and the use of close order formations to the
fullest extent possible are therefore required.</p>

<p><a name="para_366"><b>366.</b></a> In order to lighten the severe physical strain inseparable from
infantry service in campaign, constant efforts must be made to spare
the troops unnecessary hardship and fatigue; but when necessity
arises, the limit of endurance must be exacted.</p>

<p><a name="para_367"><b>367.</b></a> When officers or men belonging to fighting troops leave their
proper places to carry back, or to care for, wounded during the
progress of the action, they are guilty of skulking. This offense must
be repressed with the utmost vigor.</p>

<p><a name="para_368"><b>368.</b></a> The complete equipment of the soldier is carried into action
unless the weather or the physical condition of the men renders such
measure a severe hardship. In any event, only the pack<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> will be laid
aside. The determination of this question rests with the regimental
commander. The complete equipment affords to men lying prone
considerable protection against shrapnel.</p>

<p><a name="para_369"><b>369.</b></a> The post of the commander must be such as will enable him to
observe the progress of events and to communicate his orders.
Subordinate commanders, in addition, must be in position to transmit
the orders of superiors.</p>

<p>Before entering an action the commander should be as far to the front
as possible in order that he personally may see the situation, order
the deployment, and begin the action strictly in accordance with his
own wishes.</p>

<p>During the action, he must, as a rule, leave to the local leaders the
detailed conduct of the firing line, posting himself either with his
own reserve or in such a position that he is in constant, direct, and
easy communication with it.</p>

<p>A commander takes full and direct charge of his firing line only when
the line has absorbed his whole command.</p>

<p>When their troops are victorious, all commanders should press forward
in order to clinch the advantage gained and to use their reserves to
the best advantage.</p>

<p><a name="para_370"><b>370.</b></a> The latitude allowed to officers is in direct proportion to the
size of their commands. Each should see to the general execution of
his task, leaving to the proper subordinates the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg&#160;99]</a></span> supervision of
details, and interfering only when mistakes are made that threaten to
seriously prejudice the general plan.</p>


<h4><span class="sans"><a name="TEAMWORK"></a>Teamwork.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_371"><b>371.</b></a> The comparatively wide fronts of deployed units increase the
difficulties of control. Subordinates must therefore be given great
latitude in the execution of their tasks. The success of the whole
depends largely upon how well each subordinate coordinates his work
with the general plan.</p>

<p>A great responsibility is necessarily thrown upon subordinates, but
responsibility stimulates the right kind of an officer.</p>

<p><a name="para_372"><b>372.</b></a> In a given situation it is far better <span class="sans">to do any intelligent
thing</span> consistent with the aggressive execution of the general plan,
than to search hesitatingly for the ideal. This is the true rule of
conduct for subordinates who are required to act upon their own
initiative.</p>

<p>A subordinate who is reasonably sure that his intended action is such
as would be ordered by the commander, were the latter present and in
possession of the facts, has enough encouragement to go ahead
confidently. He must possess the loyalty to carry out the plans of his

<p><a name="para_391"><b>391.</b></a> The difficulty of reconnaissance increases in proportion to the

<p>The strength of the reconnoitering party is determined by the
character of the information desired and the nature of the hostile
screen. In exceptional cases as much as a battalion may be necessary
in order to break through the hostile screen and enable the commander
or officer in charge to reconnoiter in person.</p>

<p>A large reconnoitering party is conducted so as to open the way for
small patrols, to serve as a supporting force or rallying point for
them, and to receive and transmit information. Such parties maintain
signal communication with the main body if practicable.</p>

<p><a name="para_392"><b>392.</b></a> Each separate column moving forward to deploy must reconnoiter to

have to be hasty and superficial, whereas in an attack against an

<p>A firing or skirmish line can take care of its front, but its flanks
are especially vulnerable to modern firearms. The moral effect of
flanking fire is as great as the physical effect. Hence, combat

<h2><a name="FIRE_SUPERIORITY" id="FIRE_SUPERIORITY"></a>FIRE SUPERIORITY.</h2>


<h4><span class="sans"><a name="PURPOSE"></a>PURPOSE AND NATURE.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_400"><b>400.</b></a> In a decisive battle success depends on gaining and maintaining
fire superiority. Every effort must be made to gain it early and then
to keep it.</p>

<p>Attacking troops must first gain fire superiority in order to reach
the hostile position. Over open ground attack is possible only when
the attacking force has a decided fire superiority. With such
superiority the attack is not only possible, but success is probable
and without ruinous losses.</p>

<p>Defending troops can prevent a charge only when they can master the
enemy's fire and inflict heavy losses upon him.</p>

<p><a name="para_401"><b>401.</b></a> To obtain fire superiority it is necessary to produce a heavy
volume of accurate fire. Every increase in the effectiveness of the
fire means a corresponding decrease in the effectiveness of the
enemy's fire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg&#160;105]</a></span></p>

<p>The volume and accuracy of fire will depend upon several
considerations:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <span class="sans">The number of rifles employed.</span> On a given front the greatest
volume of fire is produced by a firing line having only sufficient
intervals between men to permit the free use of their rifles. The
maximum density of a firing line is therefore about one man per yard
of front.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The <span class="sans">rate</span> of fire affects its volume; an excessive rate reduces
its accuracy.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <span class="sans">The character of the target</span> influences both volume and
accuracy. Larger dimensions, greater visibility, and shorter range
increase the rate of fire; greater density increases the effect.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <span class="sans">Training and discipline</span> have an important bearing on the rate
or volume of fire, but their greatest influence is upon accuracy.</p>

<p>The firing efficiency, of troops is reduced by fatigue and adverse
psychological influences.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) <span class="sans">Fire direction and control</span> improve collective accuracy. The
importance of fire direction increases rapidly with the range. Control
exerts a powerful influence at all ranges.</p>


<h4><span class="sans"><a name="FIRE_DIRECTION"></a>FIRE DIRECTION AND CONTROL.</span></h4>

<h4><span class="sans">Opening Fire.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_402"><b>402.</b></a> Beyond effective ranges important results can be expected only
when the target is large and distinct and much ammunition is used.</p>

<p>Long-range fire is permissible in pursuit on account of the moral
effect of any fire under the circumstances. At other times such fire
is of doubtful value.</p>

<p><a name="para_403"><b>403.</b></a> In attack, the desire to open fire when losses are first felt
must be repressed. Considerations of time, target, ammunition, and
morale make it imperative that the attack withhold its fire and press
forward to a first firing position close to the enemy. The attacker's
target will be smaller and fainter than the one he presents to the
enemy.</p>

<p><a name="para_404"><b>404.</b></a> In defense, more ammunition is available, ranges are more easily
determined, and the enemy usually presents a larger target. The
defender may therefore open fire and expect results<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg&#160;106]</a></span> at longer ranges
than the attacker, and particularly if the defenders intend a delaying
action only.</p>

<p>If the enemy has a powerful artillery, it will often be best for the
defending infantry to withhold its fire until the enemy offers a
specially favorable target. Vigorous and well-directed bursts of fire
are then employed. The troops should therefore be given as much
artificial protection as time and means permit, and at an agreed
signal expose themselves as much as necessary and open fire.</p>

<p><a name="para_405"><b>405.</b></a> In unexpected, close encounters a great advantage accrues to the
side which first opens rapid and accurate fire with battle sight.</p>


<h4><span class="sans">Use of Ground.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_406"><b>406.</b></a> The position of the firers must afford a suitable field of fire.</p>

<p>The ground should permit constant observation of the enemy, and yet
enable the men to secure some cover when not actually firing.</p>

<p>Troops whose target is for the moment hidden by unfavorable ground,
either move forward to better ground or seek to execute cross fire on
another target.</p>

<p><a name="para_407"><b>407.</b></a> The likelihood of a target being hit depends to a great extent
upon its visibility. By skillful use of ground, a firing line may
reduce its visibility without loss of fire power. Sky lines are
particularly to be avoided.</p>


<h4><span class="sans">Choice of Target.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_408"><b>408.</b></a> The target chosen should be the hostile troops most dangerous to
the firers. These will usually be the nearest hostile infantry. When
no target is specially dangerous, that one should be chosen which
promises the most hits.</p>

<p><a name="para_409"><b>409.</b></a> Frequent changes of target impair the fire effect. Random changes
to small, unimportant targets impair fire discipline and accomplish
nothing. Attention should be confined to the main target until
substantial reason for change is apparent.</p>

<p><a name="para_410"><b>410.</b></a> An opportunity to deliver flanking fire, especially against
artillery protected in front by shields, is an example warranting
change of target and should never be overlooked. Such fire demoralizes
the troops subjected to it, even if the losses in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg&#160;107]</a></span>flicted are small.
In this manner a relatively small number of rifles can produce
important results.</p>


<h4><span class="sans">The Range.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_411"><b>411.</b></a> Beyond close range, the correct setting of the rear sight is of
primary importance, provided the troops are trained and well in hand.
The necessity for correct sight setting increases rapidly with the
range. Its importance decreases as the quality of the troops decrease,
for the error in sight setting, except possibly at very long ranges,
becomes unimportant when compared with the error in holding and
aiming.</p>

<p><a name="para_412"><b>412.</b></a> In attack, distances must usually be estimated and corrections
made as errors are observed. Mechanical range finders and ranging
volleys are practicable at times.</p>

<p>In defense, it is generally practicable to measure more accurately the
distances to visible objects and to keep a record of them for future
use.</p>


<h4><span class="sans">Distribution of Fire and Target.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_413"><b>413.</b></a> The purpose of fire superiority is to get hits whenever possible,
but at all events to keep down the enemy's fire and render it
harmless. To accomplish this the target must be covered with fire
throughout its whole extent. Troops who are not fired upon will fire
with nearly peace-time accuracy.</p>

<p>The target is roughly divided and a part is assigned to each unit. No
part of the target is neglected. In attack, by a system of overlapping
in assigning targets to platoons, the entire hostile line can be kept
under fire even during a rush.</p>


<h4><span class="sans">Observation.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_414"><b>414.</b></a> The correctness of the sight setting and the distribution of fire
over the target can be verified only by careful observation of the
target, the adjacent ground, and the effect upon the enemy.</p>

<p><a name="para_415"><b>415.</b></a> Observation only can determine whether the fire fight is being
properly conducted. If the enemy's fire is losing in accuracy and
effect, the observer realizes that his side is gaining superiority. If
the enemy's fire remains or becomes effective and persistent, he
realizes that corrective measures are necessary to increase either
volume or accuracy, or both.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg&#160;108]</a></span></p>


<h4><span class="sans">Discipline.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_416"><b>416.</b></a> Discipline makes good direction and control possible and is the
distinguishing mark of trained troops.</p>

<p><a name="para_417"><b>417.</b></a> The discipline necessary in the firing line will be absent unless
officers and noncommissioned officers can make their will known to the
men. In the company, therefore, communication must be by simple
signals which, in the roar of musketry, will attract the attention and
convey the correct meaning.</p>


<h4><span class="sans">Expenditure of Ammunition.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_418"><b>418.</b></a> In attack the supply is more limited than in defense. Better
judgment must be exercised in expenditure. Ordinarily, troops in the
firing line of an attack can not expect to have that day more
ammunition than they carry into the combat, except such additions as
come from the distribution of ammunition of dead and wounded and the
surplus brought by reinforcements.</p>

<p><a name="para_419"><b>419.</b></a> When a certain fire effect is required, the necessary ammunition
must be expended without hesitation. Several hours of firing may be
necessary to gain fire superiority. True economy can be practiced only
by closing on the enemy before first opening fire and thereafter
suspending fire when there is nothing to shoot at.</p>


<h4><span class="sans">Supporting Artillery.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_420"><b>420.</b></a> Artillery fire is the principal aid to the infantry in gaining
and keeping fire superiority, not only by its hits, but by the moral
effect it produces on the enemy.</p>

<p><a name="para_421"><b>421.</b></a> In attack, artillery assists the forward movement of the
infantry. It keeps down the fire of the hostile artillery and seeks to
neutralize the hostile infantry by inflicting losses upon it,
destroying its morale, driving it to cover, and preventing it from
using its weapons effectively.</p>

<p>In defense, it ignores the hostile artillery when the enemy's attack
reaches a decisive stage and assists in checking the attack, joining
its fire power to that of the defending infantry.</p>

<p><a name="para_422"><b>422.</b></a> Troops should be accustomed to being fired over by friendly
artillery and impressed with the fact that the artillery should
continue firing upon the enemy until the last possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg&#160;109]</a></span> moment. The
few casualties resulting from shrapnel bursting short are trifling
compared with those that would result from the increased effectiveness
of the enemy's infantry fire were the friendly artillery to cease
firing.</p>

<p>Casualties inflicted by supporting artillery are not probable until
the opposing infantry lines are less than 200 yards apart.</p>

<p><a name="para_423"><b>423.</b></a> When the distance between the hostile infantry lines becomes so
short as to render further use of friendly artillery inadvisable, the
commander of the infantry firing line, using a preconcerted signal,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
informs the artillery commander. The latter usually increases the
range in order to impede the strengthening of the enemy's foremost
line.</p>


<h4><span class="sans">Fire of Position.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_424"><b>424.</b></a> Infantry is said to execute fire of position when it is posted so
as to assist an attack by firing over the heads, or off the flank, of
the attacking troops and is not itself to engage in the advance; or
when, in defense, it is similarly posted to augment the fire of the
main firing line.</p>

<p>Machine guns serve a like purpose.</p>

<p>In a decisive action, fire of position should be employed whenever the
terrain permits and reserve infantry is available.</p>

their deployment can not be foreseen or it is desirable to shorten the
column or to clear the road. Otherwise, in the deployment of large
commands, whether in march column, in bivouac, or massed, and whether
forming for attack or for defense, they are ordinarily first formed
into a line of columns to facilitate the extension of the front prior
to deploying.</p>

<p>The rough line or lines of columns thus formed enable troops to take
advantage of the terrain in advancing and shorten the time occupied in
forming the firing line.</p>

conducts his brigade in column or in line of regiments until it is
advisable that it be broken into smaller columns. He then issues his
order, assigning to each regiment its task, if practicable. In a
similar manner the regimental commanders lead their regiments forward
in column, or in line of columns, until the time arrives for issuing
the regimental order. It is seldom advisable to break up the battalion

be occupied throughout at this density, it is generally better to
deploy companies or platoons at one man per yard, leaving gaps in the
line between them, than to distribute the men uniformly at increased
intervals.</p>

<p><a name="para_434"><b>434.</b></a> A relatively thin firing line may be employed when merely
covering the movements of other forces; when on the defensive against
poor troops; when the final action to be taken has not yet been
determined; and, in general, when fire superiority is not necessary.</p>

<p><a name="para_435"><b>435.</b></a> The length of the firing line that the whole force may employ
depends upon the density of the line and the <span class="sans">strength in rear</span>
required by the situation.</p>

<p>Supports and reserves constitute the strength in rear.</p>

<p>In a decisive attack they should be at least strong enough to replace
a heavy loss in the original firing line and to increase the charging
line to a density of at least one and one-half men per yard and still
have troops in rear for protection and for the other purposes
mentioned above.</p>

<p><a name="para_436"><b>436.</b></a> In the original deployment the strength of the reserve held out
by each commander comprises from one-sixth to two-thirds of his unit,
depending upon the nature of the service expected of the reserve.</p>

<p>A small force in a covering or delaying action requires very little
strength in rear, while a large force fighting a decisive battle
requires much. Therefore, depending upon circumstances, the original
deployment, including the strength in rear, may vary from 1 to 10 men
per yard. Against an enemy poorly disciplined and trained, or lacking
in morale, a thinner deployment is permissible.</p>

<p><a name="para_437"><b>437.</b></a> The density of the whole deployment increases with the size of
the command, because the larger the command the greater the necessity
for reserves. Thus, a battalion acting alone may attack with two men
per yard of front, but a regiment, with three battalions, may only
double the front of the one battalion.</p>

<p><a name="para_438"><b>438.</b></a> By the assignment of divisions or larger units to parts of a line
of battle several miles long, a series of semi-independent battle, or
local combat, districts are created.</p>

<p>The general deployment for a long line of battle comprising several
battle districts is not directly considered in these regula<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg&#160;112]</a></span>tions. The
deployments treated of herein are those of the infantry within such
districts.</p>

<p>The density of deployment in these districts may vary greatly,
depending upon the activity expected in each. Within these battle
districts, as well as in smaller forces acting alone, parts of the
line temporarily of less importance may be held weakly, in order to
economize troops and to have more at the decisive point.</p>

<p><a name="para_439"><b>439.</b></a> The front that a unit may occupy when deployed depends also upon
whether its flanks are secured. If both flanks are secured by other
troops, the unit may increase its front materially by reducing its
reserve or supports. If only one flank is so secured, the front may
still be somewhat increased, but the exposed flank must be guarded by
posting the supports or reserve toward that flank.</p>

<p>Natural obstacles that secure the flanks have practically the same
effect upon deployment.</p>

<p><a name="para_440"><b>440.</b></a> Except when assigned as supports or reserve, regiments in the
brigade, battalions in the regiment, and companies in the battalion
are, when practicable, deployed side by side.</p>

<p><a name="para_441"><b>441.</b></a> In the deployment, battalions establish the firing line, each
furnishing its own support.</p>

<p>In each unit larger than the battalion a reserve is held out, its
strength depending upon circumstances. In general, the reserve is
employed by the commander to meet or improve conditions brought about
by the action of the firing line. It must not be too weak or too split
up. It must be posted where the commander believes it will be needed
for decisive action, or where he desires to bring about such action.
When necessary, parts of it reenforce or prolong the firing line.</p>

both sides will probably hold a strong firing line.</p>

<p><a name="para_443"><b>443.</b></a> With large forces, a direct frontal attack gives the attacker

<p><a name="para_448"><b>448.</b></a> Cooperation between the frontal and enveloping attacks is
essential to success. Both should be pushed vigorously and

<p>The envelopment of a flank is brought about with difficulty when made
by troops already deployed in another direction or by their reserves.
The two attacks should be deployed at a suitable distance apart, with
the lines of attack converging in rear of the hostile position. The
troops that are to make the enveloping attack should deploy in the
proper direction at the start and should be given orders which enable
them to gain their point of deployment in the most direct and
practical manner.</p>

<p><a name="para_457"><b>457.</b></a> In advancing the attack, advanced elements of the firing line or

place near the enemy from which the charge may be made. Hence, in the

<p><a name="para_520"><b>520.</b></a> Meeting engagements are characterized by the necessity for hasty
reconnaissance, or the almost total absence of reconnaissance; by the
necessity for rapid deployment, frequently under fire; and usually by
the absence of trenches or other artificial cover. These conditions
give further advantages to the offensive.</p>

<p><a name="para_521"><b>521.</b></a> The whole situation will usually indicate beforehand the proper

<p><a name="para_524"><b>524.</b></a> The amount of information that the commander is warranted in

reconnaissance before the attack is launched.</p>

<p><a name="para_525"><b>525.</b></a> A great advantage accrues to the side which can deploy the

deployment, becomes more pronounced with the size of the force.</p>

<p><a name="para_526"><b>526.</b></a> The first troops to deploy will be able to attack with longer

to seize important ground.</p>

<p><a name="para_528"><b>528.</b></a> The commander of a long column which meets the enemy should be
with the advance guard to receive information promptly and to
reconnoiter. If he decides to fight, the advance guard must hold the
enemy while the commander formulates a plan of action, issues the
necessary orders, and deploys the main body. Meantime, the column

that the deployment, when determined upon, may be made more promptly.</p>

<h4><span class="sans"><a name="MACHINE_GUNS"></a>MACHINE GUNS.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_537"><b>537.</b></a> Machine guns must be considered as weapons of emergency. Their
effectiveness combined with their mobility renders them of great value
at critical, though infrequent, periods of an engagement.</p>

<p><a name="para_538"><b>538.</b></a> When operating against infantry only, they can be used to a great
extent throughout the combat as circumstances may indicate, but they
are quickly rendered powerless by efficient field artillery and will
promptly draw artillery fire whenever they open. Hence their use in
engagements between large commands must be for short periods and at
times when their great effectiveness will be most valuable.</p>

<p><a name="para_539"><b>539.</b></a> Machine guns should be attached to the advance guard. In meeting
engagements they will be of great value in assisting their own
advance, or in checking the advance of the enemy, and will have
considerable time to operate before hostile artillery fire can silence
them.</p>

<p>Care must be taken not to leave them too long in action.</p>

<p><a name="para_540"><b>540.</b></a> They are valuable to a rear guard which seeks to check a vigorous
pursuit or to gain time.</p>

<p><a name="para_541"><b>541.</b></a> In attack, if fire of position is practicable, they are of great
value. In this case fire should not be opened by the machine guns
until the attack is well advanced. At a critical period in the attack,
such fire, if suddenly and unexpectedly opened, will greatly assist
the advancing line. The fire must be as heavy as possible and must be
continued until masked by friendly troops or until the hostile
artillery finds the machine guns.</p>

<p><a name="para_542"><b>542.</b></a> In the defense, machine guns should be used in the same general
manner as described above for the attack. Concealment and patient
waiting for critical moments and exceptional opportunities are the
special characteristics of the machine gun service in decisive
actions.</p>

<p><a name="para_543"><b>543.</b></a> As part of the reserve, machine guns have special importance. If
they are with the troops told off to protect the flanks, and if they
are well placed, they will often produce de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg&#160;128]</a></span>cisive results against a
hostile turning movement. They are especially qualified to cover a
withdrawal or make a captured position secure.</p>

<p><a name="para_544"><b>544.</b></a> Machine guns should not be assigned to the firing line of an
attack. They should be so placed that fire directed upon them is not
likely to fall upon the firing line.</p>

<p><a name="para_545"><b>545.</b></a> A skirmish line can not advance by walking or running when
hostile machine guns have the correct range and are ready to fire.
Machine-gun fire is not specially effective against troops lying on
the ground or crawling.</p>

<p><a name="para_546"><b>546.</b></a> When opposed by machine guns and without artillery to destroy
them, infantry itself must silence them before it can advance.</p>

<p>An infantry command that must depend upon itself for protection
against machine guns should concentrate a large number of rifles on
each gun in turn and until it has silenced it.</p>


<h4><span class="sans"><a name="AMMUNITION"></a>AMMUNITION SUPPLY.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_547"><b>547.</b></a> The method of supply of ammunition to the combat trains is
explained in Field Service Regulations.</p>

<p><a name="para_548"><b>548.</b></a> The combat train is the immediate reserve supply of the
battalion, and the major is responsible for its proper use. He will
take measures to insure the maintenance of the prescribed allowance at
all times.</p>

<p>In the absence of instructions, he will cause the train to march
immediately in rear of his battalion, and, upon separating from it to
enter an engagement, will cause the ammunition therein to be issued.
When emptied, he will direct that the wagons proceed to the proper
rendezvous to be refilled. Ordinarily a rendezvous is appointed for
each brigade and the necessary number of wagons sent forward to it
from the ammunition column.</p>

<p><a name="para_549"><b>549.</b></a> When refilled, the combat wagons will rejoin their battalions,
or, if the latter be engaged, will join or establish communication
with the regimental reserve.</p>

<p><a name="para_550"><b>550.</b></a> Company commanders are responsible that the belts of the men in
their companies are kept filled at all times, except when the
ammunition is being expended in action. In the firing line the

a reserve, to be expended only when ordered by an officer.</p>

<p><a name="para_552"><b>552.</b></a> When necessary to resupply the firing line, ammunition will be
sent forward with reenforcements, generally from the regimental
reserve.</p>

<p>Men will never be sent back from the firing line for ammunition. Men
sent forward with ammunition remain with the firing line.</p>

<p><a name="para_553"><b>553.</b></a> As soon as possible after an engagement the belts of the men and

Ammunition which can not be reloaded on combat wagons will be piled up

<h4><span class="sans"><a name="MOUNTED"></a>MOUNTED SCOUTS.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_554"><b>554.</b></a> The mounted scouts should be thoroughly trained in patrolling and
reconnaissance. They are used for communication with neighboring
troops, for patrolling off the route of march, for march outposts,
outpost patrols, combat patrols, reconnaissance ahead of columns, etc.
Their further use is, in general, confined to escort and messenger
duty. They should be freely used for all these purposes, but for these
purposes only.</p>

<p><a name="para_555"><b>555.</b></a> When infantry is acting alone, or when the cavalry of a mixed
command has been sent to a distance, the mounted scouts are of special
importance to covering detachments and should be used to make the
reconnaissance which would otherwise fall to cavalry.</p>

<p><a name="para_556"><b>556.</b></a> In reconnaissance, scouts should be used in preference to other
troops as much as possible. When not needed for mounted duty, they
should be employed for necessary dismounted patrolling.</p>

<p><a name="para_557"><b>557.</b></a> Battalion staff officers should be specially trained in
patrolling and reconnaissance work in order that they may be available

<h4><span class="sans"><a name="NIGHT_OPERATIONS"></a>NIGHT OPERATIONS.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_558"><b>558.</b></a> By employing night operations troops make use of the cover of
darkness to minimize losses from hostile fire or to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg&#160;130]</a></span> escape
observation. Night operations may also be necessary for the purpose of
gaining time. Control is difficult and confusion is frequently
unavoidable.</p>

<p>It may be necessary to take advantage of darkness in order to assault
from a point gained during the day, or to approach a point from which
a daylight assault is to be made, or to effect both the approach and
the assault.</p>

<p><a name="para_559"><b>559.</b></a> Offensive and defensive night operations should be practiced
frequently in order that troops may learn to cover ground in the dark
and arrive at a destination quietly and in good order, and in order to
train officers in the necessary preparation and reconnaissance.</p>

<p>Only simple and well-appointed formations should be employed.</p>

<p>Troops should be thoroughly trained in the necessary details&#8212;e.g.,
night patrolling, night marching, and communication at night.</p>

<p><a name="para_560"><b>560.</b></a> The ground to be traversed should be studied by daylight and, if
practicable, at night. It should be cleared of hostile detachments
before dark, and, if practicable, should be occupied by covering
troops.</p>

<p>Orders must be formulated with great care and clearness. Each unit
must be given a definite objective and direction, and care must be
exercised to avoid collision between units.</p>

<p>Whenever contact with the enemy is anticipated, a distinctive badge
should be worn by all.</p>

<p><a name="para_561"><b>561.</b></a> Preparations must be made with secrecy. When the movement is
started, and not until then, the officers and men should be acquainted
with the general design, the composition of the whole force, and
should be given such additional information as will insure cooperation
and eliminate mistakes.</p>

<p>During the movement every precaution must be taken to keep secret the
fact that troops are abroad.</p>

<p>Unfriendly guides must frequently be impressed. These should be
secured against escape, outcry, or deception.</p>

<p>Fire action should be avoided in offensive operations. In general,
pieces should not be loaded. Men must be trained to rely upon the
bayonet and to use it aggressively.</p>

<p><a name="para_562"><b>562.</b></a> Long night marches should be made only over well-defined routes.
March discipline must be rigidly enforced. The troops should be
marched in as compact a formation as practicable, with the usual
covering detachments. Advance and rear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg&#160;131]</a></span> guard distances should be
greatly reduced. They are shortest when the mission is an offensive
one. The connecting files are numerous.</p>

<p><a name="para_563"><b>563.</b></a> A night advance made with a view to making an attack by day
usually terminates with the hasty construction of intrenchments in the
dark. Such an advance should be timed so as to allow an hour or more
of darkness for intrenching.</p>

<p>An advance that is to terminate in an assault at the break of day
should be timed so that the troops will not arrive long before the
assault is to be made; otherwise the advantage of partial surprise
will be lost and the enemy will be allowed to reenforce the threatened
point.</p>

<p><a name="para_564"><b>564.</b></a> The night attack is ordinarily confined to small forces, or to
minor engagements in a general battle, or to seizure of positions
occupied by covering or advanced detachments. Decisive results are not
often obtained.</p>

<p>Poorly disciplined and untrained troops are unfit for night attacks or
for night operations demanding the exercise of skill and care.</p>

<p>Troops attacking at night can advance close to the enemy in compact
formations and without suffering loss from hostile artillery or
infantry fire. The defender is ignorant of the strength or direction
of the attack.</p>

<p>A force which makes a vigorous bayonet charge in the dark will often
throw a much larger force into disorder.</p>

<p><a name="para_565"><b>565.</b></a> Reconnaissance should be made to ascertain the position and
strength of the enemy and to study the terrain to be traversed.
Officers who are to participate in the attack should conduct this
reconnaissance. Reconnaissance at night is especially valuable.
Features that are distinguishable at night should be carefully noted,
and their distances from the enemy, from the starting point of the
troops, and from other important points should be made known.</p>

<p>Preparations should have in view as complete a surprise as possible.
An attack once begun must be carried to its conclusion, even if the
surprise is not as complete as was planned or anticipated.</p>

<p><a name="para_566"><b>566.</b></a> The time of night at which the attack should be made depends upon
the object sought. If a decisive attack is intended, it will generally
yield the best results if made just before daylight. If the object is
merely to gain an intrenched position for further operations, an
earlier hour is necessary in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg&#160;132]</a></span> order that the position gained may be
intrenched under cover of darkness.</p>

<p><a name="para_567"><b>567.</b></a> The formation for attack must be simple. It should be carefully
effected and the troops verified at a safe distance from the enemy.
The attacking troops should be formed in compact lines and with strong
supports at short distances. The reserve should be far enough in rear
to avoid being drawn into the action until the commander so desires.
Bayonets are fixed, pieces are not loaded.</p>

<p>Darkness causes fire to be wild and ineffective. The attacking troops
should march steadily on the enemy without firing, but should be
prepared and determined to fight vigorously with the bayonet.</p>

<p>In advancing to the attack the aim should be to get as close as
possible to the enemy before being discovered, then to trust to the
bayonet.</p>

<p>If the assault is successful, preparations must be made at once to
repel a counterattack.</p>

<p><a name="para_568"><b>568.</b></a> On the defense, preparations to resist night attacks should be
made by daylight whenever such attacks are to be feared.</p>

<p>Obstacles placed in front of a defensive position are especially
valuable to the defense at night. Many forms of obstacles which would
give an attacker little concern in the daytime become serious
hindrances at night.</p>

<p>After dark the foreground should be illuminated whenever practicable
and strong patrols should be pushed to the front.</p>

<p>When it is learned that the enemy is approaching, the trenches are
filled and the supports moved close to the firing line.</p>

<p>Supports fix bayonets, but do not load. Whenever practicable and
necessary they should be used for counterattacks, preferably against a
hostile flank.</p>

<p>The defender should open fire as soon as results may be expected. This
fire may avert or postpone the bayonet combat, and it warns all

<p>They are constructed with a view to giving cover which will diminish

<p>Adjoining trenches should afford each other mutual support. The flanks
and important gaps in the line should be protected by fire trenches
echeloned in rear. (<a href="#PLATE_V">Fig. 6</a>).</p>

<p><a name="para_588"><b>588.</b></a> To locate the trace, lie on the ground at intervals and select
the best field of fire consistent with the requirements of the
situation.</p>

<p>A profile should be selected which will permit the fire to sweep the
foreground, require the minimum of labor and time, and permit the best
concealment. No fixed type can be prescribed. The type must be
selected with due regard to the terrain, the enemy, time, tools,
materials, soil, etc.</p>

<p><a name="para_589"><b>589.</b></a> <span class="sans">Hasty cover.</span> With the intrenching tool, troops can quickly
throw up a low parapet about 3 feet thick which will furnish
considerable cover against rifle fire, but scarcely any against
shrapnel. Such cover is frequently of value to an attack that is
temporarily unable to continue. In time, and particularly at night, it
may be developed into a deep fire or cover trench.</p>

<p><a name="para_590"><b>590.</b></a> <span class="sans">Fire trenches</span> should be placed and constructed so as to give a
good field of fire and to give the troops protection behind a vertical
wall, preferably with some head or overhead cover. They should be
concealed or inconspicuous in order to avoid artillery fire or to
decrease its accuracy. They should have natural or artificial
communication with their supports, but in establishing the trace this
is a secondary consideration.</p>

<p>The simplest form of fire trench is deep and narrow and has a flat,
concealed parapet. (<a href="#PLATE_V">Fig. 1.</a>) In ordinary soil, and on a basis of two
reliefs and tasks of 5 feet, it can be constructed in about two hours
with intrenching tools.</p>

<p>This trench affords fair cover for troops subjected to fire, but not
actually firing. When it is probable that time will permit
elaboration, the simple trench should be planned with a view to
developing it ultimately into a more complete form. (Figs. 2 and 3.)
Devices should be added to increase the security of the trench and the
comfort of the men.</p>

<p>Where the excavated earth is easily removed, a fire trench without
parapet may be the one best suited to the soil and other conditions
affecting the choice of profile. (<a href="#PLATE_V">Fig. 4.</a>) The enemy's infantry, as
well as his artillery, will generally have great difficulty in seeing
this type of trench.</p>

<p>In very difficult soil, if the time is short, it may be necessary to
dig a wider, shallower trench with a higher parapet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg&#160;137]</a></span></p>

<p>Head cover, notches, and loop holes are of value to troops when
firing, but many forms weaken and disclose the location of the
parapet. Filled sandbags kept in the trench when the men are not
firing may be thrown on the parapet to form notches or loopholes when
the troops in the trench open fire and concealment of the trench is no
longer necessary or possible.</p>

<p>By the use of observation stations the maximum rest and security is
afforded the troops. Stations are best located in the angles of
traverses or at the end of the trench.</p>

<p><a name="para_591"><b>591.</b></a> Where the nature of the position makes it advisable to construct
traverses at regular intervals it is generally best to construct a
section of trench for each squad, with traverses between squads. (<a href="#PLATE_V">Fig.

<p><a name="para_592"><b>592.</b></a> <span class="sans">Cover trenches</span> are placed as closely as practicable to their

adjoining fire trench.</p>

<p>The cover trench is simple and rectangular in profile. Concealment is
indispensable. It is generally concealed by the contour of the ground
or by natural features, but to guard against hostile searching fire
overhead cover is frequently advisable.</p>

<p>Cover trenches should be made as comfortable as possible. It will
often be advisable to make them extensive enough to provide cooking
and resting facilities for the garrisons of the corresponding fire
trenches.</p>

<h4><span class="sans"><a name="MINOR_WARFARE"></a>MINOR WARFARE.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_596"><b>596.</b></a> Minor warfare embraces both regular and irregular operations.</p>

<p>Regular operations consist of minor actions involving small bodies of
trained and organized troops on both sides.</p>

<p>The tactics employed are in general those prescribed for the smaller
units.</p>

<p><a name="para_597"><b>597.</b></a> Irregular operations consist of actions against unorganized or
partially organized forces, acting in independent or semi-independent
bodies. Such bodies have little or only crude training and are under
nominal and loose leadership and control. They assemble, roam about,
and disperse at will. They endeavor to win by stealth or by force of
superior numbers, employing ambuscades, sudden dashes or rushes, and
hand-to-hand fighting.</p>

<p>Troops operating against such an enemy usually do so in small units,
such as platoons, detachments, or companies, and the tactics employed
must be adapted to meet the requirements of the situation. Frequently
the enemy's own methods may be employed to advantage.</p>

<p>In general, such operations should not be undertaken hastily; every
preparation should be made to strike suddenly and to inflict the
maximum punishment.</p>

<p><a name="para_598"><b>598.</b></a> In general, the service of information will be insufficient;
adequate reconnaissance will rarely be practicable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg&#160;140]</a></span> March and bivouac
formations must be such as to admit of rapid deployment and fire
action in any direction.</p>

<p><a name="para_599"><b>599.</b></a> In the open country, where surprise is not probable, troops may
be marched in column of squads preceded, within sight, by a squad as
an advance party.</p>

<p><a name="para_600"><b>600.</b></a> In close country, where surprise is possible, the troops must be
held in a close formation. The use of flank patrols becomes difficult.
Occasionally, an advance party&#8212;never less than a squad&#8212;may be sent
out. In general, however, such a party accomplishes little, since an
enemy intent on surprise will permit it to pass unmolested and will
fall upon the main body.</p>

<p>Under such conditions, especially when the road or trail is narrow,
the column of twos or files is a convenient formation, the officers
placing themselves in the column so as to divide it into nearly equal
parts. If rushed from a flank, such a column will be in readiness to
face and fire toward either or both flank, the ranks being back to
back; if rushed from the front, the head of the column may be
deployed, the rest of the column closing up to support it and to
protect its flanks and rear. In any event, the men should be taught to
take some form of a closed back-to-back formation.</p>

<p><a name="para_601"><b>601.</b></a> The column may often be broken into two or more approximately
equal detachments separated on the march by distances of 50 to 100
yards. As a rule the detachments should not consist of less than 25
men each. With this arrangement of the column, it will rarely be
possible for an enemy to close simultaneously with all of the
detachments, one or more being left unengaged and under control to
support those engaged or to inflict severe punishment upon the enemy
when he is repulsed.</p>

<p><a name="para_602"><b>602.</b></a> The site for camp or bivouac should be selected with special
reference to economical and effective protection against surprise.
Double sentinels are posted on the avenues of approach and the troops
sleep in readiness for instant action. When practicable, troops should
be instructed in advance as to what they are to do in case of attack
at night.</p>

<p><a name="para_603"><b>603.</b></a> Night operations are frequently advisable. With the small forces

<p><a name="para_604"><b>604.</b></a> The following paragraphs on patrols are placed here for
convenience. They relate in particular to the conduct of the patrol
and its leader, and apply to patrols employed in covering detachments
as well as in combat reconnaissance.</p>

<p><a name="para_605"><b>605.</b></a> A patrol is a detachment sent out from a command to gain
information of the country or of the enemy, or to prevent the enemy
from gaining information. In special cases patrols may be given
missions other than these.</p>

<p><a name="para_606"><b>606.</b></a> The commander must have clearly in mind the purpose for which the
patrol is to be used in order that he may determine its proper
strength, select its leader, and give the latter proper instructions.</p>

<p>In general, a patrol should be sent out for one definite purpose only.</p>

<p><a name="para_607"><b>607.</b></a> The strength of a patrol varies from two or three men to a
company. It should be strong enough to accomplish its purpose, and no
stronger.</p>

<p>If the purpose is to gain information only, a small patrol is better
than a large one. The former conceals itself more readily and moves
less conspicuously. For observing from some point in plain view of the
command or for visiting or reconnoitering between outguards two men
are sufficient.</p>

<p>If messages are to be sent back, the patrol must be strong enough to
furnish the probable number of messengers without reducing the patrol
to less than two men. If hostile patrols are likely to be met and must
be driven off, the patrol must be strong.</p>

<p>In friendly territory, a weaker patrol may be used than would be used
for the corresponding purpose in hostile territory.</p>

<p><a name="para_608"><b>608.</b></a> The character of the leader selected for the patrol depends upon
the importance of the work in hand.</p>

for the simpler patrols sent out from a covering detachment, the
average soldier will be a competent leader.</p>

<p><a name="para_609"><b>609.</b></a> For a patrol sent out to gain information, or for a distant
patrol sent out from a covering detachment, the leader must be
specially selected. He must be able to cover large areas with few men;
he must be able to estimate the strength of hostile forces, to report
intelligently as to their dispositions, to read indications, and to
judge as to the importance of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg&#160;142]</a></span> information gained. He must possess
endurance, courage, and good judgment.</p>

<p>His instructions should be full and clear. He must be made to
understand exactly what is required of him, where to go and when to
return. He should be given such information of the enemy and country
as may be of value to him. He should be informed as to the general
location of his own forces, particularly of those with whom he may
come in contact. If possible, he should be given a map of the country
he is to traverse, and in many cases his route may be specified.</p>

<p>Besides his arms and ammunition, the patrol leader should have a
compass, a watch, a pencil, a note book, and, when practicable, field
message blanks and a map of the country.</p>

<p>The patrol leader assembles the men detailed for the patrol. He
inspects their arms and ammunition and satisfies himself that they are
in suitable condition for the duty. He sees that none has any papers,
maps, etc., that would be of value to the enemy if captured. He sees
that their accouterments do not glisten or rattle when they move. He
then repeats his instructions to the patrol and assures himself that
every man understands them. He explains the signals to be used and
satisfies himself that they are understood. He designates a man to
take his place should he be disabled.</p>

<p><a name="para_610"><b>610.</b></a> The formation and movements of the patrol must be regulated so as
to render probable the escape of at least one man should the patrol
encounter a superior force. The formation will depend upon the nature
of the ground traversed and the cover afforded. The leader must adopt
the formation and measures best suited to the accomplishment of his
object.</p>

<p>In general, it should have the formation of a main body with advance,
rear, and flank guards, though each be represented only by a single
man.</p>

<p><a name="para_611"><b>611.</b></a> The distances separating the members of the patrol vary according
to the ground. If too close together, they see no more than one man;
if too widely separated they are likely to be lost to the control of
the leader.</p>

<p>With a patrol of four or five men the distances may vary from 25 to 50
yards; with a larger patrol they may be as great as 100 yards.</p>

<p>At times a column of files, separated by the distances prescribed, is
a satisfactory formation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg&#160;143]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="para_612"><b>612.</b></a> The country must be carefully observed as the patrol advances. In
passing over a hill, the country beyond should first be observed by
one man; houses, inclosures, etc., should be approached in a similar
manner or avoided entirely; woods should generally be reconnoitered in
a thin skirmish line.</p>

<p><a name="para_613"><b>613.</b></a> The strength and composition of hostile troops must be observed.
If they can not be counted, their strength may be estimated by the
length of time a column consumes in passing a given point, or by the
area covered if in camp.</p>

<p>Patrol leaders should know, if practicable, the uniforms, guidons,
etc., of the enemy, as it will assist in determining the class of
troops seen when no other means for doing so are available.</p>

<p>Insignia from the enemy's uniforms, picked up by patrols, often convey
valuable information by indicating what troops are in the vicinity.</p>

<p><a name="para_614"><b>614.</b></a> Patrols avoid fighting, except in self-defense or in order to

<p><a name="para_615"><b>615.</b></a> Information gained by patrols is generally of no value unless
received in time to be of use to the commander. Patrol leaders must
therefore send back information of importance as soon as it is gained

<p><a name="para_616"><b>616.</b></a> If written, messages should state the place, date, hour, and
minute of their dispatch. The information contained in them should be
clearly and concisely expressed. They should be signed by the patrol

adhered to.</p>

<p><a name="para_617"><b>617.</b></a> If the message be an oral one, the patrol leader should require
the messenger to repeat it before starting back. In general, an oral

<p><a name="para_618"><b>618.</b></a> When in friendly territory and not very far from friendly troops,
one messenger is sufficient unless the message is very important. In

<p><a name="para_619"><b>619.</b></a> Whether the information gained is of sufficient importance to be
reported at once or may await the return of the patrol is a question
which must be decided in each case. In case of reasonable doubt, it is

received proper instructions before starting out and has the requisite
ability to lead a patrol, he can generally decide such questions
satisfactorily as they arise.</p>

<p><a name="para_620"><b>620.</b></a> Infantry patrols are generally used for work within 2 miles of

<h4><span class="sans"><a name="TRAINING"></a>TRAINING AND DISCIPLINE.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_623"><b>623.</b></a> Marching constitutes the principal occupation of troops in
campaign and is one of the heaviest causes of loss. This loss may be
materially reduced by proper training and by the proper conduct of the
march.</p>

<p><a name="para_624"><b>624.</b></a> The training of infantry should consist of systematic physical
exercises to develop the general physique and of actual marching to
accustom men to the fatigue of bearing arms and equipment.</p>

<p>Before mobilization troops should be kept in good physical condition
and so practiced as to teach them thoroughly the principles of
marching. At the first opportunity after mobilization the men should
be hardened to cover long distances without loss.</p>

<p><a name="para_625"><b>625.</b></a> With new or untrained troops, the process of hardening the men to
this work must be gradual. Immediately after being mustered into the
service the physical exercises and marching should be begun.
Ten-minute periods of vigorous setting-up exercises should be given
three times a day to loosen and develop the muscles. One march should
be made each day, with full equipment, beginning with a distance of 2
or 3 miles and increasing the distance daily as the troops become
hardened, until a full day's march under full equipment may be made
without exhaustion.</p>

<p><a name="para_626"><b>626.</b></a> A long march should not be made with untrained troops. If a long
distance must be covered in a few days, the first march should be
short, the length being increased each succeeding day.</p>

<p><a name="para_627"><b>627.</b></a> Special attention should be paid to the fitting of shoes and the
care of feet. Shoes should not be too wide or too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg&#160;146]</a></span> short. Sores and
blisters on the feet should be promptly dressed during halts. At the
end of the march feet should be bathed and dressed; the socks and, if
practicable, the shoes should be changed.</p>

<p><a name="para_628"><b>628.</b></a> The drinking of water on the march should be avoided. The thirst
should be thoroughly quenched before starting on the march and after
arrival in camp. On the march the use of water should, in general, be
confined to gargling the mouth and throat or to an occasional small
drink at most.</p>

<p><a name="para_629"><b>629.</b></a> Except for urgent reasons, marches should not begin before an
hour after daylight, but if the distance to be covered necessitates
either breaking camp before daylight or making camp after dark, it is
better to do the former.</p>

<p>Night marching should be avoided when possible.</p>

<p><a name="para_630"><b>630.</b></a> A halt of 15 minutes should be made after the first half or
three-quarters of an hour of marching; thereafter a halt of 10 minutes
is made in each hour. The number and length of halts may be varied,
according to the weather, the condition of the roads, and the
equipment carried by the men. When the day's march is long a halt of
an hour should be made at noon and the men allowed to eat.</p>

<p><a name="para_631"><b>631.</b></a> The rate of march is regulated by the commander of the leading
company of each regiment, or, if the battalions be separated by
greater than normal distances, by the commander of the leading company
of each battalion. He should maintain a uniform rate, uninfluenced by
the movements of troops or mounted men in front of him.</p>

<p>The position of companies in the battalion and of battalions in the
regiment is ordinarily changed daily so that each in turn leads.</p>

<p><a name="para_632"><b>632.</b></a> The marching efficiency of an organization is judged by the
amount of straggling and elongation and the condition of the men at
the end of the march.</p>

<p>An officer of each company marches in its rear to prevent undue
elongation and straggling.</p>

<p>When necessary for a man to fall out on account of sickness, he should
be given a permit to do so. This is presented to the surgeon, who will
admit him to the ambulance, have him wait for the trains, or follow
and rejoin his company at the first halt.</p>

<p><a name="para_633"><b>633.</b></a> Special attention should be paid to the rate of march. It is
greater for trained than for untrained troops; for small commands than
for large ones; for lightly burdened than for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg&#160;147]</a></span> heavily burdened
troops. It is greater during cool than during hot weather. With
trained troops, in commands of a regiment or less, marching over
average roads, the rate should be from 2&#190; to 3 miles per hour. With
larger commands carrying full equipment, the rate will be from 2 to
2&#189; miles per hour.</p>

<p><a name="para_634"><b>634.</b></a> The marching capacity of trained infantry in small commands is
from 20 to 25 miles per day. This distance will decrease as the size
of the command increases. For a complete division the distance can
seldom exceed 12&#189; miles per day unless the division camps in
column.</p>

<p><a name="para_635"><b>635.</b></a> In large commands the marching capacity of troops is greatly
reduced by faulty march orders and poor march discipline.</p>

<p>The march order should contain such instructions as will enable the
troops to take their proper places in column promptly. Delay or
confusion in doing so should be investigated. On the other hand,
organization commanders should be required to time their movements so
that the troops will not be formed sooner than necessary.</p>

<p>The halts and starts of the units of a column should be regulated by
the watch and be simultaneous.</p>

<p>Closing up during a halt, or changing gait to gain or lose distance
should be prohibited.</p>

<h4><span class="sans"><a name="PROTECTION"></a>PROTECTION OF THE MARCH.</span></h4>

<h4><span class="sans">General Considerations.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_636"><b>636.</b></a> A column on the march in the vicinity of the enemy is covered by
detachments called &quot;advance guards,&quot; &quot;rear guards,&quot; or &quot;flank guards.&quot;
The object of these covering detachments is to facilitate the advance
of the main body and to protect it from surprise or observation.</p>

<p>They facilitate the advance of the main body by promptly driving off
small bodies of the enemy who seek to harass or delay it; by removing
obstacles from the line of advance, by repairing roads, bridges, etc.,
thus enabling the main body to advance uninterruptedly in convenient
marching formations.</p>

<p>They protect the main body by preventing the enemy from firing into it
when in close formation; by holding the enemy and enabling the main
body to deploy before coming under effective fire; by preventing its
size and conditions from being observed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg&#160;148]</a></span> by the enemy; and, in
retreat, by gaining time for it to make its escape or to reorganize
its forces.</p>

<p><a name="para_637"><b>637.</b></a> Tactical units should not be broken in making details for
covering detachments.</p>

<p><a name="para_638"><b>638.</b></a> The march order of the whole command should explain the
situation, and, among other things, detail the commander and troops
for each covering detachment. It should specify the route to be taken
and the distance to be maintained between the main body and its
covering detachments. It should order such reconnaissance as the
commander specially desires to have made.</p>

<p>The order of the commander of a covering detachment should clearly
explain the situation to subordinates, assign the troops to the
subdivisions, prescribe their distances, and order such special
reconnaissance as may be deemed necessary in the beginning.</p>

<p>An advance or flank guard commander marches well to the front and,
from time to time, orders such additional reconnaissance or makes such
changes in his dispositions as the circumstances of the case demand.</p>


<h4><span class="sans">Advance Guards.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_639"><b>639.</b></a> An <span class="sans">advance guard</span> is a detachment of the main body which
precedes and covers it on the march.</p>

<p><a name="para_640"><b>640.</b></a> The advance guard commander is responsible for its formation and
conduct. He should bear in mind that its purpose is to facilitate and
protect the march of the main body. Its own security must be effected
by proper dispositions and reconnaissance, not by timid or cautious
advance. It must advance at normal gait and search aggressively for
information of the enemy. Its action when the enemy attempts to block
it with a large force depends upon the situation and plans of the
commander of the troops.</p>

<p><a name="para_641"><b>641.</b></a> The strength of the advance guard varies from one-twentieth to
one-third of the main body, depending upon the size of the main body
and the service expected of the advance guard.</p>

<p><a name="para_642"><b>642.</b></a> The formation of the advance guard must be such that the enemy
will be met first by a patrol, then in turn by one or more larger
detachments, each capable of holding the enemy until the next in rear
has time to deploy before coming under effective fire.</p>

<p><a name="para_643"><b>643.</b></a> Generally an advance guard consisting of a battalion or more is
divided primarily into the <span class="sans">reserve</span> and the <span class="sans">support</span>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg&#160;149]</a></span> When the
advance guard consists of less than a battalion, the reserve is
generally omitted.</p>

<p><a name="para_644"><b>644.</b></a> In an advance guard consisting of two battalions or less, the
reserve and support, if both are used, are approximately equal; in
larger advance guards, the reserve is approximately two-thirds of the
whole detachment.</p>

<p>In an advance guard consisting of one battalion, the machine guns, if
any, form part of the reserve. In an advance guard consisting of two
or more battalions, the machine guns form part of the support.</p>

<p><a name="para_645"><b>645.</b></a> The <span class="sans">support</span> sends forward an <span class="sans">advance party</span>. The <span class="sans">advance
party</span>, in turn, sends a patrol, called a <span class="sans">point</span>, still farther to
the front. Patrols are sent out to the flanks when necessary. When the
distance between parts of the advance guard or the nature of the
country is such as to make direct communication difficult, connecting
files march between the subdivisions to keep up communication. Each
element of the column sends the necessary connecting files to its
front.</p>

<p><a name="para_646"><b>646.</b></a> A battalion acting as an advance guard should be formed about as
follows: The <span class="sans">reserve</span>, two companies; the <span class="sans">support</span>, two companies;
the <span class="sans">advance party</span>, three to eight squads (about a half company),
depending upon the strength of the companies and the reconnaissance to
be made; the <span class="sans">point</span>, a noncommissioned officer and three or four men.
Or the reserve may be omitted. In such case the advance party will
consist of one company preceded by a strong point. The remaining
companies form the support.</p>

<p><a name="para_647"><b>647.</b></a> The distances separating the parts of an advance guard vary
according to the mission of the whole force, the size of the advance
guard, the proximity and character of the enemy, the nature of the
country, etc. They increase as the strength of the main body
increases; they are less when operating in rolling, broken country
than in open country; when in pursuit of a defeated enemy than against
an aggressive foe; when operating against cavalry than when against
infantry.</p>

<p>If there be a mounted point, it should precede the dismounted point by
250 to 600 yards. The advance party may be stronger when there is a
mounted point in front. The infantry maintains its gait without
reference to the mounted point, the latter regulating its march on the
former, (<i>C.I.D.R., No. 2.</i>)</p>

<p><a name="para_648"><b>648.</b></a> To afford protection to an infantry column, the country must be
observed on each side of the road as far as the terrain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg&#160;150]</a></span> affords
positions for effective rifle fire upon the column. If the country
that it is necessary to observe be open to view from the road,
<span class="sans">reconnaissance</span> is not necessary.</p>

<p><a name="para_649"><b>649.</b></a> The advance guard is responsible for the necessary reconnaissance
of the country on both sides of the line of march.</p>

<p>Special reconnaissance may be directed by the commander of the troops,
or cavalry may be reconnoitering at considerable distances to the
front and flanks, but this does not relieve the advance guard from the
duty of local reconnaissance.</p>

<p><a name="para_650"><b>650.</b></a> This reconnaissance is effected by patrols sent out by the
leading subdivisions of the advance guard. In a large advance guard
the support commander orders the necessary reconnaissance.</p>

<p>Patrols should be sent to the flanks when necessary to reconnoiter a
specified locality and should rejoin the column and their proper
subdivision as soon as practicable. When the advance party is strong
enough, the patrols should be sent out from it. When depleted by the
patrols sent out, the advance party should be reenforced during a halt
by men sent forward from the support. If it be impracticable to send
patrols from the advance party, they will be sent from the support.</p>

<p>Where the country is generally open to view, but localities in it
might conceal an enemy of some size, reconnaissance is necessary.
Where the road is exposed to fire and the view is restricted, a patrol
should be sent to examine the country in the direction from which
danger threatens. The object may be accomplished by sending patrols to
observe from prominent points. When the ground permits and the
necessity exists, patrols may be sent to march abreast of the column
at distances which permit them to see important features not visible
from the road.</p>

<p>Mounted scouts or cavalry, when available, should be used for flank
patrols.</p>

<p><a name="para_651"><b>651.</b></a> Cases may arise where the best means of covering the head and
flanks of the column will be by a line of skirmishers extending for
several hundred yards to both sides of the road, and deployed at
intervals of from 10 to 50 yards. A column may thus protect itself
when passing through country covered with high corn or similar
vegetation. In such case, the vegetation forms a natural protection
from rifle fire beyond very short ranges.</p>

<p><a name="para_652"><b>652.</b></a> Fixed rules for the strength, formation, or conduct of advance
guards can not be given. Each case must be treated to meet conditions
as they exist. That solution is generally the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg&#160;151]</a></span> best which, with the
fewest men and unbroken units, amply protects the column and
facilitates the advance.</p>


<h4><span class="sans">Rear Guards.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_653"><b>653.</b></a> A <span class="sans">rear guard</span> is a detachment detailed to protect the main body
from attack in rear. In a retreat, it checks pursuit and enables the
main body to increase the distance between it and the enemy and to
re-form if disorganized.</p>

<p>The general formation is that of an advance guard reversed.</p>

<p><a name="para_654"><b>654.</b></a> Its commander should take advantage of every favorable
opportunity to delay the pursuers by obstructing the road or by taking
up specially favorable positions from which to force the enemy to
deploy. In this latter case care must be taken not to become so
closely engaged as to render withdrawal unnecessarily difficult. The
position taken should be selected with reference to ease of withdrawal
and ability to bring the enemy under fire at long range.</p>

<p><a name="para_655"><b>655.</b></a> In large commands artillery and cavalry form a very important
part of the rear guard.</p>


<h4><span class="sans">Flank Guards.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_656"><b>656.</b></a> A <span class="sans">flank guard</span> is a detachment detailed to cover the flank of a
column marching past, or across the front of, an enemy. It may be
placed in position to protect the passage, or it may be so marched as
to cover the passage.</p>

<p><a name="para_657"><b>657.</b></a> The object of the flank guard is to hold the enemy in check long
enough to enable the main body to pass, or, like the advance guard, to
enable the main body to deploy.</p>

<p>Like all other detachments, it should be no larger than is necessary,
and should not be detailed except when its protection is required.</p>

<p><a name="para_658"><b>658.</b></a> When a flank guard consists of a regiment or less, its distance
from the main body should not exceed a mile and a half. Practicable
communication must exist between it and the main body.</p>

<p><a name="para_659"><b>659.</b></a> The flank guard is marched as a separate command; that is, with
advance or rear guards or both, as circumstances demand, and with
patrolling on the exposed flank.</p>

<p><a name="para_660"><b>660.</b></a> At times it may be necessary for an advance-guard commander to
send out large reconnoitering parties which temporarily assume the
character and duties of a flank guard. Such parties should be given
specific orders as to when and where they are to rejoin the column.</p>

<h4><span class="sans"><a name="SANITATION"></a>SANITATION.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_661"><b>661.</b></a> If the area of the available ground is sufficient and suitable,
the camp of the battalion or regiment should conform to the plates
published in the Field Service Regulations. Under similar favorable
conditions, the brigade may camp in column or in line of columns. In
the latter formation the interval between regiments should be about 50
yards. When the camp site has a restricted area, intervals and
distances are reduced.</p>

<p>Under service conditions, camp sites that will permit the encampment
of regiments and brigades as above indicated will not often be
available and regularity must be sacrificed.</p>

<p><a name="para_662"><b>662.</b></a> In large commands the halt order should assign camp sites to the
next smaller commands, and the commanders of the latter should locate
their respective commands to the best advantage on the area assigned
them.</p>


<h4><span class="sans">The Selection of Camp Sites.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_663"><b>663.</b></a> In campaign, tactical necessity may leave little choice in the
selection of camp sites, but under any conditions the requirements of
sanitation should be given every consideration consistent with the
tactical situation.</p>

<p><a name="para_664"><b>664.</b></a> Great care should be exercised in selecting sites. In general,
the following principles govern:</p>

<p>The site should be convenient to an abundant supply of pure water.</p>

<p>Good roads should lead to the camp. Interior communication throughout
the camp should be easy. A camp near a main road is undesirable on
account of dust and noise.</p>

<p>Wood, grass, forage, and supplies should be at hand or easily
obtainable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg&#160;153]</a></span></p>

<p>The ground should accommodate the command without crowding and without
compelling the troops of one unit to pass through the camp of another.</p>

<p>The site should be sufficiently high and rolling to drain off storm
water readily, and, if the season be hot, to catch the breeze. In cold
weather it should preferably have a southern exposure, with woods to
the north to break the cold winds. In warm weather an eastern
exposure, with the site moderately shaded by trees, is desirable.</p>

<p>The site should be dry. For this reason porous soil, covered with
stout turf and underlaid by a sandy or gravelly subsoil, is best. A
site on clay soil, or where the ground water approaches the surface,
is damp, cold, and unhealthful.</p>

<p>Alluvial soils, marshy ground, and ground near the base of hills, or
near thick woods or dense vegetation, are undesirable as camp sites on
account of dampness. Ravines and depressions are likely to be unduly
warm and to have insufficient or undesirable air currents.</p>

<p>Proximity to marshes or stagnant water is undesirable on account of
the dampness, mosquitoes, and the diseases which the latter transmit.
The high banks of lakes or large streams often make desirable camp
sites.</p>

<p>Dry beds of streams should be avoided; they are subject to sudden
freshet.</p>

<p><a name="para_665"><b>665.</b></a> The occupation of old camp sites is dangerous, since these are
often permeated by elements of disease which persist for considerable
periods. Camp sites must be changed promptly when there is evidence of
soil pollution or when epidemic disease threatens, but the need for
frequent changes on this account may be a reflection on the sanitary
administration of the camp.</p>

<p>A change of camp site is often desirable in order to secure a change
of surroundings and to abandon areas which have become dusty and cut
up.</p>


<h4><span class="sans">Water Supply.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_666"><b>666.</b></a> Immediately on making camp a guard should be placed over the
water supply. If the water be obtained from a stream, places should be
designated for drawing water (1) for drinking and cooking, (2) for
watering animals, (3) for bathing and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg&#160;154]</a></span> washing clothing. The first
named should be drawn farthest up the stream; the others, in the order
named, downstream.</p>

<p>If the stream be small, the water supply may be increased by building
a dam. Small springs may be dug out and each lined with a gabion, or a
barrel or box with both ends removed, or with stones, the space
between the lining and the earth being filled with puddled clay. A rim
of clay should be built to keep out surface drainage. The same method
may be used near swamps, streams, or lakes to increase or clarify the
water supply.</p>

<p><a name="para_667"><b>667.</b></a> Water that is not known to be pure should be boiled 20 minutes;
it should then be cooled and aerated by being poured repeatedly from
one clean container to another, or it may be purified by approved
apparatus supplied for the purpose.</p>

<p><a name="para_668"><b>668.</b></a> Arrangements should be made for men to draw water from the
authorized receptacles by means of a spigot or other similar
arrangement. The dipping of water from the receptacles, or the use of
a common drinking cup, should be prohibited.</p>


<h4><span class="sans">Kitchens.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_669"><b>669.</b></a> Camp kettles can be hung on a support consisting of a green pole
lying in the crotches of two upright posts of the same character.</p>

<p>A narrow trench for the fire, about 1 foot deep, dug under the pole,
not only protects the fire from the wind but saves fuel. A still
greater economy of fuel can be effected by digging a similar trench in
the direction of the wind and slightly narrower than the diameter of
the kettles. The kettles are then placed on the trench and the space
between the kettles filled in with stones, clay, etc., leaving the
flue running beneath the kettles. The draft can be improved by
building a chimney of stones, clay, etc., at the leeward end of the
flue.</p>

<p>Four such trenches radiating from a common central chimney will give
one flue for use whatever may be the direction of the wind.</p>

<p>A slight slope of the flue, from the chimney down, provides for
drainage and improves the draft.</p>

<p><a name="para_670"><b>670.</b></a> The lack of portable ovens can be met by ovens constructed of
stone and covered with earth to better retain the heat. If no stone is
available, an empty barrel, with one head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg&#160;155]</a></span> out, is laid on its side,
covered with wet clay to a depth of 6 or more inches and then with a
layer of dry earth equally thick. A flue is constructed with the clay
above the closed end of the barrel, which is then burned out with a
hot fire. This leaves a baked clay covering for the oven.</p>

<p>A recess can be similarly constructed with boards or even brushwood,
supported on a horizontal pole resting on upright posts, covered and
burnt out as in the case of the barrel.</p>

<p>When clay banks are available, an oven may be excavated therein and
used at once.</p>

<p>To bake in such ovens, first heat them and then close flues and ends.</p>

<p><a name="para_671"><b>671.</b></a> Food must be protected from flies, dust, and sun. Facilities must
be provided for cleaning and scalding the mess equipment of the men.
Kitchens and the ground around them must be kept scrupulously clean.</p>

<p><a name="para_672"><b>672.</b></a> Solid refuse should be promptly burned, either in the kitchen
fire or in an improvised crematory.</p>

<p><a name="para_673"><b>673.</b></a> In temporary camps, if the soil is porous, liquid refuse from the
kitchens may be strained through gunny sacking into seepage pits dug
near the kitchen. Flies must not have access to these pits. Boards or
poles, covered with brush or grass and a layer of earth may be used
for this purpose. The strainers should also be protected from flies.
Pits of this kind, dug in clayey soil, will not operate successfully.
All pits should be filled with earth before marching.</p>


<h4><span class="sans">Disposal of Excreta.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_674"><b>674.</b></a> Immediately on arriving in camp sinks should be dug. This is a
matter of fundamental sanitary importance, since the most serious
epidemics of camp diseases are spread from human excreta.</p>

<p>One sink is usually provided for each company and one for the officers
of each battalion. Those for the men are invariably located on the
side of camp opposite the kitchens. All sinks should be so placed that
they can not pollute the water supply or camp site as a result of
drainage or overflow. To insure this, their location and their
distance from camp may be varied.</p>

<p>When camp is made for a single night, shallow trenches, 12 inches deep
and 15 to 18 inches wide, which the men may straddle, will suffice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg&#160;156]</a></span></p>

<p>In more permanent camps, the trenches should be about 2 feet wide, 6
feet deep, and 15 feet long. They should be provided with seats and
back rests made of poles, and should be screened by brush or old tent
flys.</p>

<p><a name="para_675"><b>675.</b></a> In cold weather the contents of sinks should be covered once
daily with quicklime, ashes, or dry earth. When filled to within 2
feet of the top, sinks should be discontinued and filled in.</p>

<p>Open pits are dangerous during the fly season. However, the danger may
be greatly reduced by covering the excreta with earth or by a thorough
daily burning of the entire area of the trench. Combustible sweepings
or straw, saturated with oil, may be used for this purpose.</p>

<p>In fly season, trenches may be closed with seats covered down to the
ground with muslin and supplied with self-closing lids. Urinal
troughs, made of muslin and coated with oil or paint, should discharge
into the trenches.</p>

<p><a name="para_676"><b>676.</b></a> In permanent camps special sanitary facilities for the disposal
of excreta will ordinarily be provided.</p>

<p>If necessary, urinal tubs may be placed in the company streets at
night and removed at reveille. Their location should be plainly marked
and thoroughly and frequently disinfected.</p>

<p><a name="para_677"><b>677.</b></a> When troops bivouac for the night the necessity for extensive
sanitary precautions is not great; however, shallow sink trenches
should be dug to prevent general pollution of the vicinity. If the
cooking be collective, shallow kitchen sinks should be dug. If the
cooking be individual, the men should be required to build their fires
on the leeward flank of the camp or bivouac.</p>

<p>Before marching, all trenches should be filled in.</p>


<h4><span class="sans"><a name="PROTECTION_OF_CAMP"></a>PROTECTION OF CAMP OR BIVOUAC.</span></h4>

<h4><span class="sans">General Considerations.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_678"><b>678.</b></a> The outpost is a covering detachment detailed to secure the camp
or bivouac against surprise and to prevent an attack upon it before
the troops can prepare to resist.</p>

<p><a name="para_679"><b>679.</b></a> The size and disposition of the outpost will depend upon many
circumstances, such as the size of the whole command, the proximity of
the enemy and the situation with respect to him, the nature of the
terrain, etc.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg&#160;157]</a></span></p>

<p>A suitable strength may vary from a very small fraction to one-third
of the whole force. For a single company in bivouac a few sentinels
and patrols will suffice; for a large command a more elaborate outpost
system must be provided. It should be no stronger than is consistent
with reasonable security.</p>

<p>The most economical protection is furnished by keeping close contact
with the enemy by means of outpost patrols, in conjunction with
resisting detachments on the avenues of approach.</p>

<p>The outpost should be composed of complete organizations.</p>

<p><a name="para_680"><b>680.</b></a> In a brigade or smaller force on the march toward the enemy, the
outpost is generally formed from the advance guard, and is relieved
the following day when the new advance guard crosses the line of
outguards. In a retreat, the detail for outpost duty is generally made
from the main body. The new outpost becomes the rear guard the
following day.</p>

<p><a name="para_681"><b>681.</b></a> When, as in large forces, an advance and rear guard performs such
duty for several days, the outpost, during this period, is furnished
by the advance or rear guards.</p>

<p>When the command is small and stationary for several days, the outpost
is relieved daily. In large commands, the outpost will, as a rule, be
relieved at intervals of several days.</p>

<p><a name="para_682"><b>682.</b></a> The positions held by the subdivisions of the outpost should
generally be prepared for defense, but conditions may render this
unnecessary.</p>

<p>Troops on outpost keep concealed as much as is consistent with the
proper performance of their duties; especially do they avoid appearing
on the sky line.</p>

<p>Outpost troops do not render honors.</p>


<h4><span class="sans">Distribution of Outpost Troops.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_683"><b>683.</b></a> The outpost will generally be divided into three parts. These, in
order from the main body, are the <span class="sans">reserve</span>, the line of <span class="sans">supports</span>,
and the line of <span class="sans">outguards</span>.</p>

<p>The distances separating these parts, and their distance from the main
body, will depend upon the object sought, the nature of the terrain,
and the size of the command. There can be no uniformity in the
distance between supports and reserve, nor between outguards and
supports, even in the same outpost. The avenues of approach and the
important features of the terrain will largely control their exact
positions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg&#160;158]</a></span></p>

<p>The outpost of a small force should ordinarily hold the enemy beyond
effective rifle range of the main body until the latter can deploy.
For the same purpose the outpost of a large force should hold the
enemy beyond artillery range.</p>

<p><a name="para_684"><b>684.</b></a> The <span class="sans">reserve</span> constitutes the main body of the outpost and is
held at some central point from which it can readily <span class="sans">support the
troops in front</span> or <span class="sans">hold a rallying position</span> on which they may
retire. The reserve may be omitted when the outpost consists of less
than two companies.</p>

<p>The reserve may comprise one-fourth to two-thirds of the strength of
the outpost.</p>

<p><a name="para_685"><b>685.</b></a> The <span class="sans">supports</span> constitute a line of <span class="sans">supporting</span> and <span class="sans">resisting</span>
detachments, varying in size from a half company to a battalion. They
furnish the line of <span class="sans">outguards</span>.</p>

<p>The supports are numbered consecutively from right to left. They are
placed at the more important points on the outpost line, usually in
the line on which resistance is to be made in case of attack.</p>

<p><a name="para_686"><b>686.</b></a> As a general rule, roads exercise the greatest influence on the
location of supports, and a support will generally be placed on or
near a road. The section which it is to cover should be clearly
defined by means of tangible lines on the ground and should be such
that the support is centrally located therein.</p>

<p><a name="para_687"><b>687.</b></a> The <span class="sans">outguards</span> constitute the line of small detachments farthest
to the front and nearest to the enemy. For convenience they are
classified as <span class="sans">pickets</span>, <span class="sans">sentry squads</span>, and <span class="sans">cossack posts</span>. They
are numbered consecutively from right to left in each support.</p>

<p><a name="para_688"><b>688.</b></a> A <span class="sans">picket</span> is a group consisting of two or more squads,
ordinarily not exceeding half a company, posted in the line of
outguards to cover a given sector. It furnishes patrols and one or
more sentinels, double sentinels, sentry squads, or cossack posts for
<span class="sans">observation</span>.</p>

<p>Pickets are placed at the more important points in the line of
outguards, such as road forks. The strength of each depends upon the
number of small groups required to observe properly its sector.</p>

<p><a name="para_689"><b>689.</b></a> A <span class="sans">sentry squad</span> is a squad posted in <span class="sans">observation</span> at an
indicated point. It posts a double sentinel in observation, the
remaining men resting near by and furnishing the reliefs of sentinels.
In some cases it may be required to furnish a patrol.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg&#160;159]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="para_690"><b>690.</b></a> A <span class="sans">cossack post</span> consists of four men. It is an <span class="sans">observation</span>
group similar to a sentry squad, but employs a single sentinel.</p>

<p><a name="para_691"><b>691.</b></a> At night, it will sometimes be advisable to place some of the
outguards or their sentinels in a position different from that which
they occupy in the daytime. In such case the ground should be
carefully studied before dark and the change made at dusk. However, a
change in the position of the outguard will be exceptional.</p>

<p><a name="para_692"><b>692.</b></a> <span class="sans">Sentinels</span> are generally used singly in daytime, but at night
double sentinels will be required in most cases. Sentinels furnished
by cossack posts or sentry squads are kept near their group. Those
furnished by pickets may be as far as 100 yards away.</p>

<p>Every sentinel should be able to communicate readily with the body to
which he belongs.</p>

<p><a name="para_693"><b>693.</b></a> Sentinel posts are numbered consecutively from right to left in
each outguard. Sentry squads and cossack posts furnished by pickets
are counted as sentinel posts.</p>

<p><a name="para_694"><b>694.</b></a> Instead of using outguards along the entire front of observation,
part of this front may be covered by <span class="sans">patrols</span> only. These should be
used to cover such sections of the front as can be crossed by the
enemy only with difficulty and over which he is not likely to attempt
a crossing after dark.</p>

<p>In daylight much of the local patrolling may be dispensed with if the
country can be seen from the posts of the sentinels. However, patrols
should frequently be pushed well to the front unless the ground in
that direction is exceptionally open.</p>

<p><a name="para_695"><b>695.</b></a> Patrols or sentinels must be the first troops which the enemy
meets, and each body in rear must have time to prepare for the blow.
These bodies cause as much delay as possible without sacrificing
themselves, and gradually retire to the line where the outpost is to
make its resistance.</p>

<p><a name="para_696"><b>696.</b></a> Patrols must be used to keep up connection between the parts of
the outpost except when, during daylight, certain fractions or groups
are mutually visible. After dark this connection must be maintained
throughout the outpost except where the larger subdivisions are
provided with wire communication.</p>

<p><a name="para_697"><b>697.</b></a> In addition to ordinary outguards, the outpost commander may
detail from the reserve one or more <span class="sans">detached posts</span> to cover roads or
areas not in the general line assigned to the supports.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg&#160;160]</a></span></p>

<p>In like manner the commander of the whole force may order <span class="sans">detached
posts</span> to be sent from the main body to cover important roads or
localities not included in the outpost line.</p>

<p>The number and strength of detached posts are reduced to the absolute
needs of the situation.</p>


<h4><span class="sans">Establishing the Outpost.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_698"><b>698.</b></a> The outpost is posted as quickly as possible so that the troops
can the sooner obtain rest. Until the leading outpost troops are able
to assume their duties, temporary protection, known as the <span class="sans">march
outpost</span>, is furnished by the nearest available troops.</p>

<p><a name="para_699"><b>699.</b></a> The halt order of the commander, besides giving the necessary
information and assigning camp sites to the parts of the command,
details the troops to constitute the outpost, assigns a commander
therefor, designates the general line to be occupied, and, when
practicable, points out the position to be held in case of attack.</p>

<p><a name="para_700"><b>700.</b></a> The outpost commander, upon receipt of this order, should issue
the outpost order with the least practicable delay. In large commands
it may often be necessary to give the order from the map, but usually
the outpost commander will have to make some preliminary
reconnaissance, unless he has an accurate and detailed map.</p>

<p>The order gives such available information of the situation as is
necessary to the complete and proper guidance of subordinates;
designates the troops to constitute the supports; assigns their
location and the sector each is to cover; provides for the necessary
detached posts; indicates any special reconnaissance that is to be
made; orders the location and disposition of the reserve; disposes of
the train if same is ordered to join the outpost; and informs
subordinates where information will be sent.</p>

<p><a name="para_701"><b>701.</b></a> Generally it is preferable for the outpost commander to give
verbal orders to his support commanders from some locality which
overlooks the terrain. The time and locality should be so selected
that the support commanders may join their commands and conduct them
to their positions without causing unnecessary delay to their troops.
The reserve commander should, if possible, receive his orders at the
same time as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg&#160;161]</a></span> support commanders. Subordinates to whom he gives
orders separately should be informed of the location of other parts of
the outpost.</p>

<p>In large outposts, written orders are frequently most convenient.</p>

<p>After issuing the initial orders, the outpost commander inspects the
outpost, orders the necessary changes or additions, and sends his
superior a report of his dispositions.</p>

<p><a name="para_702"><b>702.</b></a> The <span class="sans">reserve</span> is marched to its post by its commander, who then
sends out such detachments as have been ordered and places the rest in
camp or bivouac, over which at least one sentinel should be posted.
Connection must be maintained with the main body, the supports and
nearby detached posts.</p>

<p><a name="para_703"><b>703.</b></a> The <span class="sans">supports</span> march to their posts, using the necessary covering
detachments when in advance of the march outpost. A support
commander's order should fully explain the situation to subordinates,
or to the entire command, if it be small. It should detail the troops
for the different outguards and, when necessary, define the sector
each is to cover. It should provide the necessary sentinels at the
post of the support, the patrols to be sent therefrom, and should
arrange for the necessary intrenching. Connection should be maintained
with adjoining supports and with the outguards furnished by the
support.</p>

<p><a name="para_704"><b>704.</b></a> In posting his command the support commander must seek to cover
his sector in such manner that the enemy can not reach, in dangerous
numbers and unobserved, the position of the support or pass by it
within the sector intrusted to the support. On the other hand, he must
economize men on observation and patrol duty, for these duties are
unusually fatiguing. He must practice the greatest economy of men
consistent with the requirements of practical security.</p>

<p><a name="para_705"><b>705.</b></a> As soon as the posting of the support is completed, its commander
carefully inspects the dispositions and corrects defects, if any, and
reports the disposition of his support, including the patrolling
ordered, to the outpost commander. This report is preferably made by
means of a sketch.</p>

<p><a name="para_706"><b>706.</b></a> Each <span class="sans">outguard</span> is marched by its commander to its assigned
station, and, especially in the case of a picket, is covered by the
necessary patrolling to prevent surprise.</p>

<p>Having reached the position, the commander explains the situation to
his men and establishes reliefs for each sentinel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg&#160;162]</a></span> and, if possible,
for each patrol to be furnished. Besides these sentinels and patrols,
a picket must have a sentinel at its post.</p>

<p>The commander then posts the sentinels and points out to them the
principal features, such as towns, roads, and streams, and gives their
names. He gives the direction and location of the enemy, if known, and
of adjoining parts of the outpost.</p>

<p>He gives to patrols the same information and the necessary orders as
to their routes and the frequency with which the same shall be
covered. Each patrol should go over its route once before dark.</p>

<p><a name="para_707"><b>707.</b></a> Every picket should maintain connection by patrols with outguards
on its right and left. Each commander will take precaution to conceal
his outguard and will generally strengthen his position by
intrenching.</p>

<p>Noncommissioned staff officers, noncommissioned officers in command of
subdivisions, and the drum major salute, turn the head and eyes,
return to the front, resume the carry or drop the hand, at the points
prescribed for the major. Officers and dismounted noncommissioned
officers in command of subdivisions with arms in hand render the rifle
or saber salute. Guides charged with the step, trace, and direction do
not execute <span class="sans">eyes right</span>.</p>

<p>If the reviewing officer is entitled to a salute from the colors, the
regimental color salutes when at 6 paces from him, and is raised when
at 6 paces beyond him.</p>

<p>The major, having saluted, takes post on the right of the reviewing
officer, returns saber and remains there until the rear of the
battalion has passed, then salutes, draws saber, and rejoins his

left, back to the regiment, the band playing; the march is so
conducted that when the escort arrives at 50 paces in front of the
right of the regiment, the direction of the march shall be parallel to
its front; when the color arrives opposite its place in line, the
escort is formed in line to the left; the color bearer, passing
between the platoons, advances and halts 12 paces in front of the
colonel.</p>

the command of the colonel, after which the captain forms it again in
column of platoons, and, preceded by the band, marches it to its
place, passing around the left flank of the regiment.</p>

<p>The band plays until the escort passes the left of the line, when it
ceases playing and returns to its post on the right, passing in rear

all rise, uncover, and remain standing at attention until the officer
leaves the room or directs otherwise. Enlisted men at meals stop
eating and remain seated at attention.</p>

<p>(3) An enlisted man, if seated, rises on the approach of an officer,

an officer for the same purpose. If the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg&#160;181]</a></span> parties remain in the same
place or on the same ground, such compliments need not be repeated.
Soldiers actually at work do not cease work to salute an officer
unless addressed by him.</p>

salute with the weapon with which he is armed, or, if unarmed, with
the right hand. He also makes the same salute after receiving a reply.</p>

<p>(5) In uniform, covered or uncovered, but not in formation, officers

hand, the salute prescribed for that arm (sentinels on interior guard
duty excepted); without arms, the right-hand salute.</p>

<p>(6) In civilian dress, covered or uncovered, officers and enlisted men
salute military persons with the right-hand salute.</p>

military manner, the officer junior in rank, or the enlisted men,
saluting first. When several officers in company are saluted, all
entitled to the salute shall return it.</p>

<p>(8) Except in the field under campaign or simulated campaign

a superior officer not mounted.</p>

<p>(9) A man in formation shall not salute when directly addressed, but
shall come to attention if at rest or at ease.</p>

<p>(10) Saluting distance is that within which recognition is easy. In
general, it does not exceed 30 paces.</p>

<p>(11) When an officer entitled to the salute passes in rear of a body
of troops, it is brought to attention while he is opposite the post of
the commander.</p>

and in public places, such as theaters, honors and personal salutes

<h4><span class="sans">Shelter Tents.</span></h4>

<p><b><a name="para_792" href="#APPENDIX_B">792.</a></b> Being in line or in column of platoons, the captain commands:
<span class="sans">FORM FOR SHELTER TENTS</span>.</p>

<p>The officers, first sergeant, and guides fall out; the cooks form a
file on the flank of the company nearest the kitchen, the first
sergeant and right guide fall in, forming the right file of the
company; blank files are filled by the file closers or by men taken
from the front rank; the remaining guide, or guides, and file closers
form on a convenient flank. Before forming column of platoons,
preparatory to pitching tents, the company may be redivided into two
or more platoons, regardless of the size of each. (<i>C.I.D.R., No. 2.</i>)</p>

<p><b><a name="para_793" href="#APPENDIX_B">793.</a></b> The captain then causes the company to take intervals as
described in the <a href="#SCHOOL_OF_THE_SQUAD">School of the Squad</a>, and commands: <span class="sans">PITCH TENTS</span>.</p>

<p>At the command <span class="sans">pitch tents</span>, each man steps off obliquely to the
right with the right foot and lays his rifle on the ground, the butt
of the rifle near the toe of the right foot, muzzle to the front,
barrel to the left, and steps back into his place; each front-rank man
then draws his bayonet and sticks it in the ground by the outside of
the right heel.</p>

<p>Equipments are unslung, packs opened, shelter half and pins removed;
each man then spreads his shelter half, small triangle to the rear,
flat upon the ground the tent is to occupy, the rear-rank man's half
on the right. The halves are then buttoned together; the guy loops at
both ends of the lower half are passed through the buttonholes
provided in the lower and upper halves; the whipped end of the guy
rope is then passed through both guy loops and secured, this at both
ends of the tent. Each front-rank man inserts the muzzle of his rifle
under the front end of the ridge and holds the rifle upright, sling to
the front, heel of butt on the ground beside the bayonet. His
rear-rank man pins down the front corners of the tent on the line of
bayonets, stretching the tent taut; he then inserts a pin in the eye
of the front guy rope and drives the pin at such a distance in front
of the rifle as to hold the rope taut; both men go to the rear of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg&#160;194]</a></span>
tent, each pins down a corner, stretching the sides and rear of the
tent before securing; the rear-rank man then inserts an intrenching
tool, or a bayonet in its scabbard, under the rear end of the ridge
inside the tent, the front-rank man pegging down the end of the rear
guy ropes; the rest of the pins are then driven by both men, the
rear-rank man working on the right.</p>

<p>The front flaps of the tent are not fastened down, but thrown back on
the tent.</p>

<p>As soon as the tent is pitched each man arranges his equipment and the
contents of his pack in the tent and stands at attention in front of
his own half on line with the front guy-rope pin.</p>

<p>To have a uniform slope when the tents are pitched, the guy ropes
should all be of the same length.</p>

<p>In shelter-tent camps, in localities where suitable material is
procurable, tent poles may be improvised and used in lieu of the rifle
and bayonet or intrenching tool as supports for the shelter tent.

<h4><span class="sans">Common and Wall Tents.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_799"><b>799.</b></a> To pitch all types of Army tents, except shelter and conical wall
tents: Mark line of tents by driving a wall pin on the spot to be
occupied by the right (or left) corner of each tent. For pyramidal
tents the interval between adjacent pins should be about 30 feet,
which will give a passage of two feet between tents. Spread tripod on
the ground where the center of tent is to be, if tripod is used.
Spread the tent on the ground to be occupied, door to the front, and
place the right (or left) front wall loop over the pin. The door (or
doors, if more than one) being fastened and held together at the
bottom, the left (or right) corner wall loop is carried to the left
(or right) as far as it will go and a wall pin driven through it, the
pin being placed in line with the right (or left) corner pins already
driven. At the same time the rear corner wall loops are pulled to the
rear and outward so that the rear wall of the tent is stretched to
complete the rectangle. Wall pins are then driven through these loops.
Each corner pin should be directly in rear of the corresponding front
corner pin, making a rectangle. Unless the canvas be wet, a small
amount of slack should be allowed before the corner pins are driven.
According to the size of the tent one or two men, crawling under the
tent if necessary, fit each pole or ridge or upright into the ring or
ridge pole holes, and such accessories as hood, fly, and brace ropes
are adjusted. If a tripod be used an additional man will go under the
tent to adjust it. The tent, steadied by the remaining men, one at
each corner guy rope, will then be raised. If the tent is a ward or
storage type, corner poles will now be placed at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg&#160;196]</a></span> four corners.
The four corner guy ropes are then placed over the lower notches of
the large pins driven in prolongation of the diagonals at such
distance as to hold the walls and ends of the tent vertical and smooth
when the guy ropes are drawn taut. A wall pin is then driven through
each remaining wall loop and a large pin for each guy rope is driven
in line with the corner guy pins already driven. The guy ropes of the
tent are placed over the lower notches, while the guy ropes of the fly
are placed over the upper notches, and are then drawn taut. Brace
ropes, when used, are then secured to stakes or pins suitably placed.

lowered, folded, or rolled and tied, the poles or tripod and pole
fastened together, and the remaining pins collected.</p>


<h4><span class="sans">To Fold Tents.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_803"><b>803.</b></a> For folding common, wall, hospital, and storage tents: Spread the
tent flat on the ground, folded at the ridge so that bottoms of side
walls are even, ends of tent forming triangles to the right and left;
fold the triangular ends of the tent in toward the middle, making it
rectangular in shape; fold the top over about 9 inches; fold the tent
in two by carrying the top<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg&#160;197]</a></span> fold over clear to the foot; fold again in
two from the top to the foot; throw all guys on tent except the second
from each end; fold the ends in so as to cover about two-thirds of the
second cloths; fold the left end over to meet the turned-in edge of
the right end, then fold the right end over the top, completing the
bundle; tie with the two exposed guys.</p>


<h4><span class="sans">Method of Folding Pyramidal Tent.</span></h4>

<p>The tent is thrown toward the rear and the back wall and roof canvas
pulled out smooth. This may be most easily accomplished by leaving the
rear-corner wall pins in the ground with the wall loops attached, one
man at each rear-corner guy, and one holding the square iron in a
perpendicular position and pulling the canvas to its limit away from
the former front of the tent. This leaves the three remaining sides of
the tent on top of the rear side, with the door side in the middle.</p>

<p>Now carry the right-front corner over and lay it on the left-rear
corner. Pull all canvas smooth, throw guys toward square iron, and
pull bottom edges even. Then take the right-front corner and return to
the right, covering the right-rear corner. This folds the right side
of the tent on itself, with the crease in the middle and under the
front side of tent.</p>

<p>Next carry the left-front corner to the right and back as described
above; this when completed will leave the front and rear sides of the
tent lying smooth and flat and the two side walls folded inward, each
on itself.</p>

<p>Place the hood in the square iron which has been folded downward
toward the bottom of tent, and continue to fold around the square iron
as a core, pressing all folds down flat and smooth, and parallel with
the bottom of the tent. If each fold is compactly made and the canvas
kept smooth, the last fold will exactly cover the lower edge of the
canvas. Lay all exposed guys along the folded canvas except the two on
the center width, which should be pulled out and away from bottom edge
to their extreme length for tying. Now, beginning at one end, fold
toward the center on the first seam (that joining the first and second
widths) and fold again toward the center so that the already folded
canvas will come to within about 3 inches of the middle width. Then
fold over to the opposite edge of middle width of canvas. Then begin
folding from opposite end,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg&#160;198]</a></span> folding the first width in half, then
making a second fold to come within about 4 or 5 inches of that
already folded, turn this fold entirely over that already folded. Take
the exposed guys and draw them taut across each other, turn bundle
over on the under guy, cross guys on top of bundle drawing tight. Turn
bundle over on the crossed guys and tie lengthwise.</p>

<p>When properly tied and pressed together this will make a package 11 by
23 by 34 inches, requiring about 8,855 cubic inches to store or pack.</p>

<p>If the bayonet scabbard is carried on the belt: Take the position of
parade rest, grasp the handle of the bayonet firmly with the right
hand, press the spring with the forefinger of the left hand, raise the
bayonet until the handle is about 6 inches above the muzzle of the
piece, drop the point to the left, back of hand toward the body, and,
glancing at the scabbard, return the bayonet, the blade passing
between the left arm and body; regrasp the piece with the right hand
and resume the order.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg&#160;218]</a></span></p>

<p>If the bayonet scabbard is carried on the haversack: Take the bayonet
from the rifle with the left hand and return it to the scabbard in the
most convenient manner.</p>

<p>If marching or lying down, the bayonet is fixed and unfixed in the
most expeditious and convenient manner and the piece returned to the
original position.</p>

<p>Fix and unfix bayonet are executed with promptness and regularity, but
not in cadence.</p>

<p><b>98.</b> Being at order arms: 1. <span class="sans">Inspection</span>, 2. <span class="sans">ARMS</span>.</p>

<p>At the second command, take the position of port arms. (<span class="sans">TWO</span>) With
the right hand open the magazine gate, turn the bolt handle up, draw
the bolt back and glance at the magazine and chamber. Having found
them empty, or having emptied them, raise the head and eyes to the
front.</p>

<p><b>99.</b> Being at inspection arms: 1. <span class="sans">Order (Right shoulder, port)</span>, 2.
<span class="sans">ARMS</span>.</p>

<p>At the preparatory command, push the bolt forward, turn the handle
down, close the magazine gate, pull the trigger, and resume port arms.
At the command <span class="sans">arms</span>, complete the movement ordered.</p>

<p><b>134.</b> Pieces being loaded and in the position of load, to execute other
movements with the pieces loaded: 1. <span class="sans">Lock</span>, 2. <span class="sans">PIECES</span>.</p>

<p>At the command <span class="sans">Pieces</span> turn the safety lock fully to the right.</p>

<p>The safety lock is said to be at the &quot;ready&quot; when turned to the left,
and at the &quot;safe&quot; when turned to the right.</p>

<p>The cut-off is said to be &quot;on&quot; when turned up and &quot;off&quot; when turned
down.</p>

<p><b>139.</b> Being in line or skirmish line at halt: 1. <span class="sans">With dummy (blank or
ball) cartridges</span>, 2. <span class="sans">LOAD</span>.</p>

<p>At the command <span class="sans">load</span> each front-rank man or skirmisher faces half
right and carries the right foot to the right, about one foot, to such
position as will insure the greatest firmness and steadiness of the
body; raises or lowers the piece and drops it into the left hand at
the balance, left thumb extended along the stock, muzzle at the height
of the breast. With the right hand he turns and draws the bolt back,
takes a cartridge between the thumb and first two fingers find places
it in the receiver; places palm of the hand against the back of the
bolt handle;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg&#160;219]</a></span> thrusts the bolt home with a quick motion, turning down
the handle, and carries the hand to the small of the stock. Each
rear-rank man moves to the right front, takes a similar position
opposite the interval to the right of his front-rank man, muzzle of
the piece extending beyond the front rank, and loads.</p>

<p>A skirmish line may load while moving, the pieces being held as nearly
as practicable in the position of load.</p>

<p>If kneeling or sitting the position of the piece is similar; if
kneeling the left forearm rests on the left thigh; if sitting the
elbows are supported by the knees. If lying down the left hand
steadies and supports the piece at the balance, the toe of the butt
resting on the ground, the muzzle off the ground.</p>

<p>For reference, these positions (standing, kneeling, and lying down)
are designated as that of <span class="sans">load</span>.</p>

<p><b>141.</b> <span class="sans">FILL MAGAZINE.</span></p>

<p>Take the position of load, if not already there, open the gate of the
magazine with the right thumb, take five cartridges from the box or
belt, and place them, with the bullets to the front, in the magazine,
turning the barrel slightly to the left to facilitate the insertion of
the cartridges; close the gate and carry the right hand to the small
of the stock.</p>

<p>To load from the magazine the command <span class="sans">From magazine</span> will be given
preceding that of <span class="sans">LOAD</span>; the <span class="sans">cut-off</span> will be turned up on coming to
the position of <span class="sans">load</span>.</p>

<p>To resume loading from the belt the command <span class="sans">From belt</span> will be given
preceding the command <span class="sans">LOAD</span>; the <span class="sans">cut-off</span> will be turned down on
coming to the position of <span class="sans">load</span>.</p>

<p>The commands <span class="sans">from magazine</span> and <span class="sans">from belt</span>, indicating the change in
the manner of loading, will not be repeated in subsequent commands.</p>

<p>The words <span class="sans">from belt</span> apply to cartridge box as well as belt.</p>

<p>In loading from the magazine care should be taken to push the bolt
fully forward and turn the handle down before drawing the bolt back,
as otherwise the extractor will not catch the cartridge in the
chamber, and jamming will occur with the cartridge following.</p>

<p>To fire from the magazine, the command <span class="sans">MAGAZINE FIRE</span> may be given at
any time. The cut-off is turned up and an increased rate of fire is
executed. After the magazine is exhausted the cut-off is turned down
and the firing continued, loading from the belt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg&#160;220]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sans">Magazine fire</span> is employed only when, in the opinion of the platoon
leader or company commander, the maximum rate of fire becomes
necessary.</p>

<p><b>142.</b> <span class="sans">UNLOAD.</span></p>

<p>All take the position of load, turn the <span class="sans">cut-off</span> up, if not already
there, turn the safety lock to the left, and alternately open and
close the chamber until all the cartridges are ejected. After the last
cartridge is ejected the chamber is closed and the trigger pulled. The
cartridges are then picked up, cleaned, and returned to the box or
belt, and the piece brought to the order.</p>

<p><b>148.</b> <span class="sans">CLIP FIRE.</span></p>

<p>Turn the cut-off up; <span class="sans">fire at will</span> (reloading from the magazine)
until the cartridges in the piece are exhausted; turn the cut-off
down; fill magazine; reload and take the position of <span class="sans">suspend firing</span>.</p>

<p><b>747.</b> If the inspection is to include an examination of the blanket
rolls the captain, before dismissing the company and after inspecting
the file closers, directs the lieutenants to remain in place, closes
ranks, stacks arms, dresses the company back to four paces from the
stacks, takes intervals, and commands: 1. <span class="sans">Unsling</span>, 2. <span class="sans">PACKS</span>, 3.
<span class="sans">Open</span>, 4. <span class="sans">PACKS</span>.</p>

<p>At the second command each man unslings his roll and places it on the
ground at his feet, rounded end to the front, square end of shelter
half to the right.</p>

<p>At the fourth command the rolls are untied, laid perpendicular to the
front with the triangular end of the shelter half to the front,
opened, and unrolled to the left; each man prepares the contents of
his roll for inspection and resumes the attention.</p>

<p>The captain then returns saber, passes along the ranks and file
closers as before, inspects the rolls, returns to the right, draws
saber and commands: 1. <span class="sans">Close</span>, 2. <span class="sans">PACKS</span>.</p>

<p>At the second command each man, with his shelter half smoothly spread
on the ground with buttons up and triangular end to the front, folds
his blanket once across its length and places it upon the shelter
half, fold toward the bottom, edge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg&#160;222]</a></span> one-half inch from the square end,
the same amount of canvas uncovered at the top and bottom. He then
places the parts of the pole on the side of the blanket next the
square end of shelter half, near and parallel to the fold, end of pole
about 6 inches from the edge of the blanket; nests the pins similarly
near the opposite edge of the blanket and distributes the other
articles carried in the roll; folds the triangular end and then the
exposed portion of the bottom of the shelter half over the blanket.</p>

<p>The two men in each file roll and fasten first the roll of the front
and then of the rear rank man. The file closers work similarly two and
two, or with the front rank man of a blank file. Each pair stands on
the folded side, rolls the blanket roll closely and buckles the
straps, passing the end of the strap through both keeper and buckle,
back over the buckle and under the keeper. With the roll so lying on
the ground that the edge of the shelter half can just be seen when
looking vertically downward one end is bent upward and over to meet
the other, a clove hitch is taken with the guy rope first around the
end to which it is attached and then around the other end, adjusting
the length of rope between hitches to suit the wearer.</p>

<p>As soon as a file completes its two rolls each man places his roll in
the position it was in after being unslung and stands at attention.</p>

<p>All the rolls being completed, the captain commands: 1. <span class="sans">Sling</span>, 2.
<span class="sans">PACKS</span>.</p>

<p>At the second command the rolls are slung, the end containing the pole
to the rear.</p>

<p>The company is assembled, takes arms, and the captain completes the
inspection as before.</p>

<p><b>792.</b> Being in line or in column of platoons, the captain commands:
<span class="sans">FORM FOR SHELTER TENTS</span>.</p>

<p>The officers, first sergeant, and guides fall out; the cooks form a
file on the flank of the company nearest the kitchen, the first
sergeant and right guide fall in, forming the right file of the
company; blank files are filled by the file closers or by men taken
from the front rank; the remaining guide or guides, and file closers
form on a convenient flank. Before forming column of platoons,
preparatory to pitching tents, the company may be redivided into two
or more platoons regardless of the size of each. (<i>C.I.D.R., No. 2.</i>)</p>

<p><b>793.</b> The captain then causes the company to take intervals as
described in the <a href="#SCHOOL_OF_THE_SQUAD">School of the Squad</a>, and commands: <span class="sans">PITCH TENTS</span>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg&#160;223]</a></span></p>

<p>At the command <span class="sans">pitch tents</span>, each man steps off obliquely to the
right with the right foot and lays his rifle on the ground, the butt
of the rifle near the toe of the right foot, muzzle to the front,
barrel to the left, and steps back into his place; each front rank man
then draws his bayonet and sticks it in the ground by the outside of
the right heel. All unsling and open the blanket rolls and take out
the shelter half, poles, and pins. Each then spreads his shelter half,
triangle to the rear, flat upon the ground the tent is to occupy, rear
rank man's half on the right. The halves are then buttoned together.
Each front rank man joins his pole, inserts the top in the eyes of the
halves, and holds the pole upright beside the bayonet placed in the
ground; his rear rank man, using the pins in front, pins down the
front corners of the tent on the line of bayonets, stretching the
canvas taut; he then inserts a pin in the eye of the rope and drives
the pin at such distance in front of the pole as to hold the rope
taut. Both then go to the rear of the tent; the rear rank man adjusts
the pole and the front rank man drives the pins. The rest of the pins
are then driven by both men, the rear rank man working on the right.</p>

<p>As soon as the tent is pitched each man arranges the contents of the
blanket roll in the tent and stands at attention in front of his own
half on line with the front guy rope pin.</p>

<p>The guy ropes, to have a uniform slope when the shelter tents are
pitched, should all be of the same length. (<i>C.I.D.R., Nos. 2 and 8.</i>)</p>

<p><b>794.</b> When the blanket roll is not carried, intervals are taken as
described above; the position of the front pole is marked with a
bayonet and equipments are laid aside. The men then proceed to the
wagon, secure their rolls, return to their places, and pitch tents as
heretofore described.</p>

<p><b>795.</b> To pitch double shelter tent, the captain gives the same commands
as before, except <span class="sans">Take half interval</span> is given instead of <span class="sans">Take
interval</span>. In taking interval each man follows the preceding man at 2
paces. The captain then commands: <span class="sans">PITCH DOUBLE TENTS</span>.</p>

<p>The first sergeant places himself on the right of the right guide and
with him pitches a single shelter tent.</p>

<p>Only the odd numbers of the front rank mark the line with the bayonet.</p>

<p>The tent is formed by buttoning together the square ends of two single
tents. Two complete tents, except one pole, are used. Two guy ropes
are used at each end, the guy pins being placed in front of the corner
pins.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg&#160;224]</a></span></p>

<p>The tents are pitched by numbers 1 and 2, front and rear rank; and by
numbers 3 and 4, front and rear rank; the men falling in on the left
are numbered, counting off if necessary.</p>

<p>All the men spread their shelter halves on the ground the tent is to
occupy. Those of the front rank are placed with the triangular ends to
the front. All four halves are then buttoned together, first the
ridges and then the square ends. The front corners of the tent are
pinned by the front-rank men, the odd number holding the poles, the
even number driving the pins. The rear-rank men similarly pin the rear
corners.</p>

<p>While the odd numbers steady the poles, each even number of the front
rank takes his pole and enters the tent, where, assisted by the even
number of the rear rank, he adjusts the pole to the center eyes of the
shelter halves in the following order: (1) The lower half of the front
tent; (2) the lower half of the rear tent; (3) the upper half of the
front tent; (4) the upper half of the rear tent. The guy ropes are
then adjusted.</p>

<p>The tents having been pitched, the triangular ends are turned back,
contents of the rolls arranged, and the men stand at <span class="sans">attention</span>, each
opposite his own shelter half and facing out from the tent.</p>

<p><a name="para_2a"><b>2.</b></a> The object of this instruction is to teach the soldier how to make
effective use of the rifle and bayonet in personal combat; to make him
quick and proficient in handling his rifle; to give him an accurate
eye and a steady hand; and to give him confidence in the bayonet in
offense and defense. When skill in these exercises has been acquired,
the rifle will still remain a most formidable weapon at close quarters

<h3>THE BAYONET.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Nomenclature and Description.</span></h4>

<p><a name="para_11a"><b>11.</b></a> The bayonet is a cutting and thrusting weapon consisting of three
principal parts, viz, the <i>blade</i>, <i>guard</i>, and <i>grip</i>.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/bayonet.png" width="651" height="283" alt="bayonet" title="bayonet" /></p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg&#160;229]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="para_12a"><b>12.</b></a> The blade has the following parts: Edge, false edge, back,
grooves, point, and tang. The length of the blade from guard to point
is 16 inches, the edge 14.5 inches, and the false edge 5.6 inches.
Length of the rifle, bayonet fixed, is 59.4 inches. The weight of the
bayonet is 1 pound; weight of rifle without bayonet is 8.69 pounds.
The center of gravity of the rifle, with bayonet fixed, is just in
front of the rear sight.</p>


<h3>I. INSTRUCTION WITHOUT THE RIFLE.</h3>

<p><a name="para_13a"><b>13.</b></a> The instructor explains the importance of good footwork and
impresses on the men the fact that quickness of foot and suppleness of
body are as important for attack and defense as is the ability to
parry and deliver a strong point or cut.</p>

<p><a name="para_14a"><b>14.</b></a> All foot movements should be made from the position of <i>guard</i>. As
far as practicable, they will be made on the balls of the feet to
insure quickness and agility. No hard and fast rule can be laid down
as to the length of the various foot movements; this depends entirely
on the situations occurring in combat.</p>

<p><a name="para_15a"><b>15.</b></a> The men having taken intervals or distances, the instructor
commands:</p>

<p>1. <span class="sans">Bayonet exercise</span>, 2. <span class="sans">GUARD</span>.</p>

<p>At the command <span class="sans">guard</span>, half face to the right, carry back and place
the right foot about once and a half its length to the rear and about
3 inches to the right, the feet forming with each other an angle of
about 60&#176;, weight of the body balanced equally on the balls of the
feet, knees slightly bent, palms of hands on hips, fingers to the
front, thumbs to the rear, head erect, head and eyes straight to the
front.</p>

<p>The passes are used to get quickly within striking distance or to
withdraw quickly therefrom.</p>

<p><a name="para_21a"><b>21.</b></a> 1. <span class="sans">Right</span>, 2. <span class="sans">STEP</span>. Step to the right with the right foot about

once its length and place the right foot in its proper relative
position.</p>

<p>These steps are used to circle around an enemy, to secure a more
favorable line of attack, or to avoid the opponent's attack. Better
ground or more favorable light may be gained in this way. In bayonet
fencing and in actual combat the foot first moved in stepping to the
right or left is the one which at the moment bears the least weight.</p>


<h3>II. INSTRUCTION WITH THE RIFLE.</h3>

<p><a name="para_23a"><b>23.</b></a> The commands for and the execution of the foot movements are the
same as already given for movements without the rifle.</p>

<p>At the second command take the position of guard (see <a href="#para_15a">par. 15</a>); at the
same time throw the rifle smartly to the front, grasp the rifle with
the left hand just below the lower band, fingers between the stock and
gun sling, barrel turned slightly to the left, the right hand grasping
the small of the stock about 6 inches in front of the right hip,
elbows free from the body, bayonet point at the height of the chin.</p>

<p><a name="para_25a"><b>25.</b></a> 1. <span class="sans">Order</span>, 2. <span class="sans">ARMS</span>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Attacks.</span></h3>

<p><a name="para_27a"><b>27.</b></a> 1. <span class="sans">THRUST.</span></p>

<p>Thrust the rifle quickly forward to the full length of the left arm,
turning the barrel to the left, and direct the point of the bayonet at
the point to be attacked, butt covering the right forearm. At the same
time straighten the right leg vigorously and throw the weight of the
body forward and on the left leg, the ball of the right foot always on
the ground. Guard is resumed immediately without command.</p>

<p>The force of the thrust is delivered principally with the right arm,
the left being used to direct the bayonet. The points at which the
attack should be directed are, in order of their importance, stomach,
chest, head, neck, and limbs.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p><a name="para_28a"><b>28.</b></a> 1. <span class="sans">LUNGE.</span></p>

<p>Executed in the same manner as the thrust, except that the left foot
is carried forward about twice its length. The left heel must always
be in rear of the left knee. Guard is resumed immediately without
command. Guard may also be resumed by advancing the right foot if, for
any reason, it is desired to hold the ground gained in lunging. In the
latter case, the preparatory common <span class="sans">forward</span> will be given. Each
method should be practiced.</p>

<p>Straighten right arm and right leg vigorously and swing butt of rifle
against point of attack, pivoting the rifle in the left hand at about
the height of the left shoulder, allowing the bayonet to pass to the
rear on the left side of the head. Guard is resumed without command.</p>

<p>The points of attack in their order of importance are, head, neck,
stomach, and crotch.</p>

<p><a name="para_30a"><b>30.</b></a> 1. <span class="sans">Cut</span>, 2. <span class="sans">DOWN</span>.</p>

<p>Execute a quick downward stroke, edge of bayonet directed at point of

<p><a name="para_31a"><b>31.</b></a> 1. <span class="sans">Cut</span>, 2. <span class="sans">RIGHT (LEFT)</span>.</p>

<p>With a quick extension of the arms execute a cut to the right (left),
directing the edge toward the point attacked. Guard is resumed without
command.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg&#160;235]</a></span></p>

<p>The cuts are especially useful against the head, neck, and hands of an
enemy. In executing left cut it should be remembered that the false,
or back edge, is only 5.6 inches long. The cuts can be executed in
continuation of strokes, thrusts, lunges, and parries.</p>

<p><a name="para_32a"><b>32.</b></a> To direct an attack to the right, left, or rear the soldier will

<p>Whenever possible the impetus gained by the turning movement of the
body should be thrown into the attack. In general this will be best
accomplished by turning on the ball of the right foot.</p>

<p>These movements constitute a change of front in which the position of
guard is resumed at the completion of the movement.</p>

together into a cable between 6 and 12 inches in diameter. Old rope is
preferable. Bags weighted and stuffed with hay, straw, shavings, etc.,
are also suitable.</p>

muzzle, barrel down, thumbs around the stock and toward the butt; at
the same time raise the rifle above the shoulder farthest from the
opponent, butt elevated and to the rear, elbows slightly bent and
knees straight. Each individual takes such position of the feet,
shoulders, and hands as best accords with his natural dexterity.
<span class="sans">SWING.</span> Tighten the grasp of the hands and swing the rifle to the
front and downward, directing it at the head of the opponent and
immediately return to the position of <span class="sans">club rifle</span> by completing the
swing of the rifle downward and to the rear. Repeat by the command,
<span class="sans">SWING</span>.</p>

<p>The rifle should be swung with sufficient force to break through any
guard or parry that may be interposed.</p>

<p>The use of this attack against dummies or in fencing is prohibited.</p>

<p><a name="para_45a"><b>45.</b></a> The position of <span class="sans">club rifle</span> may be taken from any position of the

the bayonet.</p>


<h3>IV. COMBINED MOVEMENTS.</h3>

<p><a name="para_46a"><b>46.</b></a> The purpose of combined movements is to develop more vigorous
attacks and more effective defenses than are obtained by the single
movements; to develop skill in passing from attack to defense and the
reverse. Every movement to the front should be accompanied by an
attack, which is increased in effectiveness by the forward movement of
the body. Every movement to the rear should ordinarily be accompanied
by a parry and should always be followed by an attack. Movements to
the right or left may be accompanied by attacks or defenses.</p>

<p><a name="para_47a"><b>47.</b></a> Not more than three movements will be used in any combination. The

<h3>V. PRACTICAL BAYONET COMBAT.</h3>

<p><a name="para_49a"><b>49.</b></a> The principles of practical bayonet combat should be taught as far
as possible during the progress of instruction in bayonet exercises.</p>

<p><a name="para_50a"><b>50.</b></a> The soldier must be continually impressed with the extreme
importance of the offensive due to its moral effect. Should an attack
fail, it should be followed immediately by another attack before the
opponent has an opportunity to assume the offensive. Keep the opponent
on the defensive. If, due to circumstances, it is necessary to take
the defensive, constantly watch for an opportunity to assume the
offensive and take immediate advantage of it.</p>

<p><a name="para_51a"><b>51.</b></a> Observe the ground with a view to obtaining the best footing. Time
for this will generally be too limited to permit more than a single
hasty glance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg&#160;243]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="para_52a"><b>52.</b></a> In personal combat watch the opponent's eyes if they can be
plainly seen, and do not fix the eyes on his weapon nor upon the point
of your attack. If his eyes can not be plainly seen, as in night
attacks, watch the movements of his weapon and of his body.</p>

<p><a name="para_53a"><b>53.</b></a> Keep the body well covered and deliver attacks vigorously. The
point of the bayonet should always be kept as nearly as possible in
the line of attack. The less the rifle is moved upward, downward, to
the right, or to the left, the better prepared the soldier is for
attack or defense.</p>

<p><a name="para_54a"><b>54.</b></a> Constantly watch for a chance to attack the opponent's left hand.
His position of <span class="sans">guard</span> will not differ materially from that described
in <a href="#para_24a">paragraph 24</a>. If his bayonet is without a cutting edge, he will be
at a great disadvantage.</p>

<p><a name="para_55a"><b>55.</b></a> The butt is used for close and sudden attacks. It is particularly
useful in riot duty. From the position of port arms a sentry can
strike a severe blow with the butt of the rifle.</p>

<p><a name="para_56a"><b>56.</b></a> Against a man on foot, armed with a sword, be careful that the
muzzle of the rifle is not grasped. All the swordsman's energies will
be directed toward getting past the bayonet. Attack him with short,
stabbing thrusts, and keep him beyond striking distance of his weapon.</p>

<p><a name="para_57a"><b>57.</b></a> The adversary may attempt a greater extension in the thrust and
lunge by quitting the grasp of his piece with the left hand and
advancing the right as far as possible. When this is done, a sharp
parry may cause him to lose control of his rifle, leaving him exposed
to a counter attack, which should follow promptly.</p>

<p><a name="para_58a"><b>58.</b></a> Against odds a small number of men can fight to best advantage by
grouping themselves so as to prevent their being attacked from behind.</p>

<p><a name="para_59a"><b>59.</b></a> In fighting a mounted man armed with a saber every effort must be
made to get on his near or left side, because here his reach is much
shorter and his parries much weaker. If not possible to disable such
an enemy, attack his horse and then renew the attack on the horseman.</p>

<h3>VI. FENCING EXERCISES.</h3>

<p><a name="para_61a"><b>61.</b></a> Fencing exercises in two lines consist of combinations of thrusts,
parries, and foot movements executed at command or at will, the
opponent replying with suitable parries and returns.</p>

<p><a name="para_62a"><b>62.</b></a> The instructor will inspect the entire fencing equipment before
the exercise begins and assure himself that everything is in such
condition as will prevent accidents.</p>

<p><a name="para_63a"><b>63.</b></a> The men equip themselves and form in two lines at the order,
facing each other, with intervals of about 4 paces between files and a
distance of about 2 paces between lines. One line is designated as
number 1; the other, number 2. Also as attack and defense.</p>

<p><a name="para_64a"><b>64.</b></a> The opponents being at the order facing each other, the instructor
commands: <span class="sans">SALUTE</span>.</p>

<p>Each man, with eyes on his opponent, carries the left hand smartly to
the right side, palm of the hand down, thumb and fingers extended and
joined, forearm horizontal, forefinger touching the bayonet. (Two.)
Drop the arm smartly by the side.</p>

<p>This salute is the fencing salute.</p>

<p>All fencing exercises and all fencing at will between individuals will
begin and terminate with the formal courtesy of the fencing salute.</p>

<p><a name="para_65a"><b>65.</b></a> After the fencing salute has been rendered the instructor
commands: 1. <span class="sans">Fencing exercise</span>, 2. <span class="sans">GUARD</span>.</p>

<p>At the command <span class="sans">guard</span> each man comes to the position of <span class="sans">guard</span>,
heretofore defined, bayonets crossed, each man's bayonet bearing
lightly to the right against the corresponding portion of the
opponent's bayonet. This position is known as the <span class="sans">engage</span> or <span class="sans">engage
right</span>.</p>

<p><a name="para_66a"><b>66.</b></a> Being at the <span class="sans">engage right</span>: <span class="sans">ENGAGE LEFT</span>.</p>

<p>The attack drops the point of his bayonet quickly until clear of his
opponent's rifle and describes a semicircle with it upward and to the
right; bayonets are crossed similarly as in the en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg&#160;245]</a></span>gaged position,

<p><a name="para_67a"><b>67.</b></a> Being at <span class="sans">engage left</span>: <span class="sans">ENGAGE RIGHT</span>.</p>

<p>The attack quickly drops the point of his bayonet until clear of his
opponent's rifle and describes a semicircle with it upward and to the
left and <span class="sans">engages</span>.</p>

<p><a name="para_70a"><b>70.</b></a> 1. <span class="sans">Number one, ENGAGE RIGHT (LEFT)</span>; 2. <span class="sans">Number two, COUNTER</span>.</p>

<p>Number one executes the movement ordered, as above; number two quickly
drops the point of his bayonet and circles it upward to the original
position.</p>

<p><a name="para_71a"><b>71.</b></a> In all fencing while maintaining the pressure in the engage, a
certain freedom of motion of the rifle is allowable, consisting of the
play, or up-and-down motion, of one bayonet against the other. This is
necessary to prevent the opponent from divining the intended attack.
It also prevents his using the point of contact as a pivot for his
assaults. In changing from one engage to the other the movement is
controlled by the left hand, the right remaining stationary.</p>

<p><a name="para_72a"><b>72.</b></a> After some exercise in <span class="sans">engage</span>, <span class="sans">engage left</span>, and <span class="sans">counter</span>,
exercises will be given in the <span class="sans">assaults</span>.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Assaults.</span></h3>

<p><a name="para_73a"><b>73.</b></a> The part of the body to be attacked will be designated by name, as
head, heck, chest, stomach, legs. No attacks will be made below the
knees. The commands are given and the movements for each line are
first explained thoroughly by the instructor; the execution begins at
the command <span class="sans">assault</span>. Number one executes the attack, and number two
parries; conversely, at command, number two attacks and number one
parries.</p>

<p><a name="para_74a"><b>74.</b></a> For convenience in instruction <span class="sans">assaults</span> are divided into <span class="sans">simple

<h3><span class="smcap">Simple Attacks.</span></h3>

<p><a name="para_75a"><b>75.</b></a> Success in these attacks depends on quickness of movement. There
are three simple attacks&#8212;the <span class="sans">straight</span>, the <span class="sans">disengagement</span>, and the
<span class="sans">counter disengagement</span>. They are not preceded by a feint.</p>

<p><a name="para_76a"><b>76.</b></a> In the <span class="sans">straight</span> the bayonet is directed straight at an opening
from the engaged position. Contact with the opponent's rifle may, or
may not, be abandoned while making it. If the opening be high or low,
contact with the rifle will usually be abandoned on commencing the
attack. If the opening be near his guard, the light pressure used in
the engage may be continued in the attack.</p>

<p>Example: Being at the <span class="sans">engage right</span>, 1. <span class="sans">Number one, at neck</span> (head,
chest, right leg, etc.), <span class="sans">thrust</span>; 2. <span class="sans">Number two, parry right</span>; 3.
<span class="sans">ASSAULT</span>.</p>

<p><a name="para_77a"><b>77.</b></a> In the <span class="sans">disengagement</span> contact with the opponent's rifle is
abandoned and the point of the bayonet is circled <span class="sans">under</span> or <span class="sans">over</span>
his bayonet or rifle and directed into the opening attacked. This
attack is delivered by one continuous spiral movement of the bayonet
from the moment contact is abandoned.</p>

<p>Example: Being at the <span class="sans">engage right</span>, 1. <span class="sans">Number one</span>, at stomach
(left chest, left leg, etc.), <span class="sans">thrust</span>; 2. <span class="sans">Number two, parry left</span>
(etc.); 3. <span class="sans">ASSAULT</span>.</p>

<p><a name="para_78a"><b>78.</b></a> In the <span class="sans">counter disengagement</span> a swift attack is made into the
opening disclosed while the opponent is attempting to change the
engagement of his rifle. It is delivered by one continuous spiral
movement of the bayonet into the opening.</p>

<p>Example: Being at the <span class="sans">engage right</span>, 1. <span class="sans">Number two, engage left</span>; 2.
<span class="sans">Number one</span>, at chest, <span class="sans">thrust</span>; 3. <span class="sans">Number two, parry left</span>; 4.
<span class="sans">ASSAULT</span>.</p>

<p>Number two initiates the movement, number one thrusts as soon as the
opening is made, and number two then attempts to parry.</p>

<p><a name="para_79a"><b>79.</b></a> A <span class="sans">counter attack</span> or <span class="sans">return</span> is one made instantly after or in
continuation of a parry. The parry should be as narrow as possible.
This makes it more difficult for the opponent to recover and counter
parry. The counter attack should also be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg&#160;247]</a></span> made at, or just before, the
full extension of the opponent's attack, as when it is so made, a
simple extension of the arms will generally be sufficient to reach the
opponent's body.</p>

<p>Example: Being at <span class="sans">engage</span>, 1. <span class="sans">Number two</span>, at chest, <span class="sans">lunge</span>; 2.
<span class="sans">Number one, parry right</span>, and at stomach (chest, head, etc.),
<span class="sans">thrust</span>; 3. <span class="sans">ASSAULT</span>.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Attacks on the Rifle.</span></h3>

<p><a name="para_80a"><b>80.</b></a> These movements are made for the purpose of forcing or disclosing
an opening into which an attack can be made. They are the <span class="sans">press</span>,
the <span class="sans">beat</span>, and the <span class="sans">twist</span>.</p>

<p><a name="para_81a"><b>81.</b></a> In the <span class="sans">press</span> the attack quickly presses against the opponent's
bayonet or rifle with his own and continues the pressure as the attack
is delivered.</p>

<p>Example: Being at the <span class="sans">engage</span>, 1. <span class="sans">Number one, press</span>, and at chest,
<span class="sans">thrust</span>; 2. <span class="sans">Number two, parry right</span>; 3. <span class="sans">ASSAULT</span>.</p>

<p><a name="para_82a"><b>82.</b></a> The attack by <span class="sans">disengagement</span> is particularly effective following
<span class="sans">the press</span>.</p>

<p>Example: Being at the <span class="sans">engage</span>, 1. <span class="sans">Number one, press</span>, and at
stomach, <span class="sans">thrust</span>; 2. <span class="sans">Number two, low parry left</span>; 3. <span class="sans">ASSAULT</span>.</p>

<p><a name="para_83a"><b>83.</b></a> The <span class="sans">beat</span> is an attack in which a sharp blow is struck against
the opponent's rifle for the purpose of forcing him to expose an
opening into which an attack immediately follows. It is used when
there is but slight opposition or no contact of rifles.</p>

<p>Example: Being at the <span class="sans">engage</span>, 1. <span class="sans">Number one, beat</span>, and at stomach
(chest, etc.), <span class="sans">thrust</span>; 2. <span class="sans">Number two, parry left</span>; 3. <span class="sans">ASSAULT</span>.</p>

<p><a name="para_84a"><b>84.</b></a> In the <span class="sans">twist</span> the rifle is crossed over the opponent's rifle or
bayonet and his bayonet forced downward with a circular motion and a
straight attack made into the opening. It requires superior strength
on the part of the attack.</p>

<p>Example: Being at the <span class="sans">engage</span>, 1. <span class="sans">Number one, twist</span>, and at
stomach, <span class="sans">thrust</span>; 2. <span class="sans">Number two, low parry, left</span>; 3. <span class="sans">ASSAULT</span>.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Feints.</span></h3>

<p><a name="para_85a"><b>85.</b></a> Feints are movements which threaten or simulate attacks and are
made with a view to inducing an opening or parry that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg&#160;248]</a></span> exposes the
desired point of attack. They are either single or double, according
to the number of such movements made by the attack.</p>

<p><a name="para_86a"><b>86.</b></a> In order that the attack may be changed quickly, as little force
as possible is put into a feint.</p>

<p>Example: Being at the <span class="sans">engage</span>, <span class="sans">Number one, feint</span> head <span class="sans">thrust</span>; at
stomach, <span class="sans">lunge</span>; 2. <span class="sans">Number two, parry right and low parry right</span>; 3.
<span class="sans">ASSAULT</span>.</p>

<p>Number one executes the feint and then the attack. Number two executes
both parries.</p>

<p><a name="para_87a"><b>87.</b></a> In double feints first one part of the body and then another is
threatened and a third attacked.</p>

<p>Example: Being at the <span class="sans">engage</span>, 1. <span class="sans">Number one, feint straight thrust</span>
at chest; <span class="sans">disengagement</span> at chest; at stomach, <span class="sans">lunge</span>; 2. <span class="sans">Number
two, parry right, parry left</span>, and <span class="sans">low parry left</span>; 3. <span class="sans">ASSAULT</span>.</p>

<p><a name="para_88a"><b>88.</b></a> An opening may be offered or procured by opposition, as in the
<span class="sans">press</span> or <span class="sans">beat</span>.</p>

<p><a name="para_89a"><b>89.</b></a> In fencing exercises every feint should at first be parried. When
the defense is able to judge or divine the character of the attack the
feint is not necessarily parried, but may be nullified by a counter
feint.</p>

<p><a name="para_90a"><b>90.</b></a> A <span class="sans">counter feint</span> is a feint following the opponent's feint or
following a parry of his attack and generally occurs in combined
movements.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Combined Movements.</span></h3>

<p><a name="para_91a"><b>91.</b></a> When the men have become thoroughly familiar with the various foot
movements, parries, guards, attacks, feints, etc., the instructor
combines several of them and gives the commands in quick succession,
increasing the rapidity and number of movements as the men become more
skillful. Opponents will be changed frequently.</p>

<p>1. Example: Being at the <span class="sans">engage</span>, 1. <span class="sans">Number one, by disengagement</span>
at chest, <span class="sans">thrust</span>; 2. <span class="sans">Number two, parry left, right step</span> (left foot
first), and <span class="sans">lunge</span>; 3. <span class="sans">ASSAULT</span>.</p>

<p>2. Example: Being at <span class="sans">engage left</span>, <span class="sans">Number one, press</span> and <span class="sans">lunge</span>;
2. <span class="sans">Number two, parry right, left step</span>, and <span class="sans">thrust</span>; 3. <span class="sans">ASSAULT</span>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg&#160;249]</a></span></p>

chest, <span class="sans">thrust</span>; 2. <span class="sans">Number two, parry left, front pass</span>, and at head
<span class="sans">butt strike</span>; 3. <span class="sans">Number one, right step</span>; 4. <span class="sans">ASSAULT</span>.</p>

<p><a name="para_92a"><b>92.</b></a> Examples 1 and 2 are typical of movements known as <span class="sans">cross
counters</span>, and example No. 3 of movements known as <span class="sans">close counters</span>.</p>

<p><a name="para_93a"><b>93.</b></a> A <span class="sans">chancery</span> is an attack by means of which the opponent is
disarmed, which causes him to lose control of his rifle, or which
disables his weapon.</p>

<p><a name="para_94a"><b>94.</b></a> When the different combinations are executed with sufficient skill
the instructor will devise series of movements to be memorized and
executed at the command <span class="sans">assault</span>. The accuracy and celerity of the
movements will be carefully watched by the instructor, with a view to
the correction of faulty execution.</p>

<p><a name="para_95a"><b>95.</b></a> It is not intended to restrict the number of movements, but to
leave to the discretion of company commanders and the ingenuity of

<h3>VII. FENCING AT WILL.</h3>

<p><a name="para_96a"><b>96.</b></a> As satisfactory progress is made the instructor will proceed to
the exercises at will, by which is meant assaults between two men,
each endeavoring to hit the other and to avoid being hit himself.
Fencing at will should not be allowed to degenerate into random
attacks and defenses.</p>

<p><a name="para_97a"><b>97.</b></a> The instructor can supervise but one pair of combatants at a time.
Frequent changes should be made so that the men may learn different
methods of attack and defense from each other.</p>

<p><a name="para_98a"><b>98.</b></a> The contest should begin with simple, careful movements, with a
view to forming a correct opinion of the adversary; afterwards
everything will depend on coolness, rapid and correct execution of the
movements and quick perception of the adversary's intentions.</p>

<p><a name="para_99a"><b>99.</b></a> Continual retreat from the adversary's attack and frequent dodging
to escape attacks should be avoided. The offensive should be
continually encouraged.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg&#160;250]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="para_100a"><b>100.</b></a> In fencing at will, when no commands are given, opponents facing
each other at the position of order arms, salute. They then
immediately and simultaneously assume the position of guard, rifles
engaged. Neither man may take the position of guard before his
opponent has completed his salute. The choice of position is decided
before the salute.</p>

<p><a name="para_101a"><b>101.</b></a> The opponents being about two paces apart and the fencing salute
having been rendered, the instructor commands, <span class="sans">At will</span>, 2.

interrupt the contest the instructor will command <span class="sans">HALT</span>, at which the
combatants will immediately come to the order. To terminate the
contest the instructor will command, 1. <span class="sans">Halt</span>, 2. <span class="sans">SALUTE</span>, at which
the combatants will immediately come to the order, salute, and remove
their masks.</p>

<p><a name="para_102a"><b>102.</b></a> When men have acquired confidence in fencing at will, one
opponent should be required to advance upon the other in quick time at
<span class="sans">charge bayonet</span>, from a distance not to exceed 10 yards, and deliver
an attack. As soon as a hit is made by either opponent the instructor
commands, <span class="sans">HALT</span>, and the assault terminates. Opponents alternate in
assaulting. The assailant is likewise required to advance at double
time from a distance not exceeding 20 yards and at a run from a
distance not exceeding 30 yards.</p>

<p><a name="para_103a"><b>103.</b></a> The instructor will closely observe the contest and decide
doubtful points. He will at once stop the contest upon the slightest
indication of temper. After conclusion of the combat he will comment
on the action of both parties, point out errors and deficiencies and
explain how they may be avoided in the future.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p><a name="para_104a"><b>104.</b></a> As additional instruction, the men may be permitted to wield the
rifle left handed, that is on the left side of the body, left hand at
the small Of the stock. Many men will be able to use this method to

<p><a name="para_105a"><b>105.</b></a> After men have fenced in pairs, practice should be given in

<p>In group fencing it will be necessary to have a sufficient number of
umpires to decide hits. An individual receiving a hit is withdrawn at
once from the bout, which is decided in favor of the group having the
numerical superiority at the end. The fencing salute is not required
in group fencing.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rules for Fencing at Will.</span></h3>

<p><a name="para_106a"><b>106.</b></a> 1. Hits on the legs below the knees will not be counted. No hit
counts unless, in the opinion of the instructor, it has sufficient
force to disable.</p>

<p>2. Upon receiving a hit, call out &quot;hit.&quot;</p>

<p>3. After receiving a fair hit a counter attack is not permitted. A
position of engage is taken.</p>

<p>4. A second or third hit in a combined attack will be counted only
when the first hit was not called.</p>

<p>5. When it is necessary to stop the contest&#8212;for example, because of
breaking of weapons or displacement of means of protection&#8212;take the
position of the order.</p>

<p>6. When it is necessary to suspend the assault for any cause, it will
not be resumed until the adversary is ready and in condition to defend
himself.</p>

<p>7. Attacks directed at the crotch are prohibited in fencing.</p>

<p>8. Stepping out of bounds, when established, counts as a hit.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Suggestions for Fencing at Will.</span></h3>

<p><a name="para_107a"><b>107.</b></a> When engaging in an assault, first study the adversary's position
and proceed by false attacks, executed with speed, to discover, if
possible, his instinctive parries. In order to draw the adversary out
and induce him to expose that part of the body at which the attack is
to be made, it is advisable to simulate an attack by a feint and then
make the real attack.</p>

<p><a name="para_108a"><b>108.</b></a> Return attacks should be frequently practiced, as they are
difficult to parry, and the opponent is within easier reach and more
exposed. The return can be made a continuation of the parry, as there
is no previous warning of its delivery al<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg&#160;253]</a></span>though it should always be
expected. Returns are made without lunging if the adversary can be
reached by thrusts or cuts.</p>

<p><a name="para_109a"><b>109.</b></a> Endeavor to overcome the tendency to make a return without
knowing where it will hit. Making returns blindly is a bad habit and
leads to instinctive returns&#8212;that is, habitual returns with certain
attacks from certain parries&#8212;a fault which the skilled opponent will
soon discover.</p>

<p><a name="para_110a"><b>110.</b></a> Do not draw the rifle back preparatory to thrusting and lunging.</p>

<p><a name="para_111a"><b>111.</b></a> The purpose of fencing at will is to teach the soldier as many
forms of simple, effective attacks and defenses as possible.
Complicated and intricate movements should not be attempted.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hints for Instructors.</span></h3>

<p><a name="para_112a"><b>112.</b></a> The influence of the instructor is great. He must be master of
his weapon, not only to show the various movements, but also to lead
in the exercises at will. He should stimulate the zeal of the men and
arouse pleasure in the work. Officers should qualify themselves as
instructors by fencing with each other.</p>

<p><a name="para_113a"><b>113.</b></a> The character of each man, his bodily conformation, and his
degree of skill must always be taken into account. When the instructor
is demonstrating the combinations, feints, returns, and parries the
rapidity of his attack should be regulated by the skill of the pupil
and no more force than is necessary should be used. If the pupil
exposes himself too much in the feints and parries the instructor
will, by an attack, convince him of his error; but if these returns be
too swiftly or too strongly made the pupil will become overcautious
and the precision of his attack will be impaired. The object is to
teach the pupil, not to give exhibitions of superior skill.</p>

<p><a name="para_114a"><b>114.</b></a> Occasionally the instructor should leave himself uncovered and
fail to parry, in order to teach the pupil to take quick advantage of
such opportunities.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg&#160;254]</a></span></p>
